                                        PhinesChen is a project that aimed at transforming the Merced County Food Bank
                                        website and database by tackling three main issues. <br> First, the team of
                                        three UC
                                        Merced Computer Science and Engineering majors created a brand new site with
                                        updated information about the bank,<br> a map to help locate food distribution
                                        sites
                                        to anyone on the website, and a login system for the admins and users.<br><br>
                                        Second,
                                        the team digitalized the storage system by creating a backend database to store
                                        inventory information and added a front-end component for easily inputting data.
                                        Then, they built a tracker to stay informed when a shipment will reach the food
                                        bank or reach a distribution site. Lastly, they created an administrative user
                                        interface so all data related to MCFB can be tracked including amount of food,
                                        money donated/spent, requests/donation forms, and much more. All these changes
                                        were done on one web platform with intuitive and attractive design intended for
                                        ease of operation.

It brings together problem-solvers, coders, scientists, designers, storytellers, makers, builders, artists, and technologists from across the globe. The goal is to use NASA's open data to tackle real-world problems on Earth and in space. CITRIS at UC Merced is a host site for this competition.</p>

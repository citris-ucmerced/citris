These panelists are                                        here to share their thoughts with us about the intersection of water and                                        agriculture and how technology can help us build resilience.” The panel                                        discussion featured research, non-profit, and technology sector experts:Dr. Newsha Ajami,                                        Chief Strategy and Development Officer for Research, Lawrence Berkeley National                                        LaboratoryConnie Bowen,                                        Co-Founder, FarmHand Ventures, andDr. Tara Moran,                                        President and CEO, California Water Data Consortium                                        One example of technology-enabled resilience that could lead to improvements in                                        water management is using a distributed cloud-based system. This system can                                        provide data in a wide variety of ways, making it accessible to people from                                        different backgrounds and with different skill sets.                                        Speaking on this, Moran shared further about how upcoming projects can provide                                        data to a wide range of users. For example, the California Water Data Consortium                                        is currently developing an open-source groundwater accounting platform that                                        integrates data from a variety of different sources, in partnership with the                                        Environmental Defense Fund, the Department of Water Resources, and the State                                        Water Resources Control Board. “It essentially links district-level water                                        budgets directly with parcel-level information so that landowners can plan for                                        their growing season,” Moran stated. “They can really understand what their                                        water use is, how it relates to district level goals, and, and then make                                        planning decisions associated with it.” This cloud-based system helps people see                                        what wider impacts pumping water may have and what to expect within a larger                                        system, effectively sharing that data with a diverse group of interests.                                        Panelists noted data in a vacuum can be problematic as it lacks local context.                                        To ensure that technology is relevant and useful, involving local people in the                                        policymaking process is essential. For example, Dr. Ajami, during her time at                                        Stanford University, conducted a study that involved bringing local people to                                        the table to find out what questions they had in an attempt to address this                                        issue.                                        Ajami also spoke on the unintended consequences of policies that favor                                        large-scale farming, essentially overdrafting from water resources. “Groundwater                                        is an interest,” Ajami told attendees, “like your bank account. You put things                                        in, you take things out, and we need to put money back in for that savings                                        account to have a value. Otherwise, it'll be an empty account that you are never                                        able to draw from.” In one example, a tariff passed in Mexico made electricity                                        cheap, resulting in the overuse of water and overdrafting. The farm workers in                                        Baja California are now permanent in the region as a result, but they have no                                        access to sanitation, education, or water services. Technology can help address                                        these issues, but it must be designed with the people doing the work in                                        mind.                                        Connie Bowen emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary learning to address                                        the complex challenges facing California's water resources. She also spoke about                                        the need to ensure equity in policy and investment implementation. One way to                                        achieve this is to encourage different backgrounds and ways of thinking, which                                        can lead to more innovative and equitable solutions, particularly in the realms                                        of agriculture and water.                                        “Our agricultural system needs to be able to both provide cheap nutrition and                                        not do so at the expense of people,” Bowen said, discussing the current                                        challenges. “Currently, it's not quite doing that, and that is inherently                                        related to its sustainability and water management elements.” As part of one                                        solution, she recommended more frequently bringing diverse stakeholders to the                                        table, where they can be more involved in the issues that impact them.                                        To create a better, diverse, and resilient future for California's water                                        resources, it is important to involve more people at the table, discuss how                                        solutions benefit the most variety of people, and have more leaders from                                        different backgrounds with resources and capital. It is also vital to be aware                                        of how venture capital works and encourage different backgrounds and ways of                                        thinking while learning how to deal with disagreements and accept other                                        cultures.                                        In addition, academic interdisciplinary collaboration can foster an exchange of                                        knowledge to help tackle the complex challenges facing both California's water                                        resources and those worldwide. As Dr. Ajami shares at the end of the panel, “The                                        day that we break some of these existing fragmented systems and have more                                        interdisciplinary people educated at academic institutions that think about                                        systems rather than just one box at a time... will be my happy day because I                                        know that those create exchanges that expand people’s thinking and knowledge.”                                    ",

Data are collected at every step of the production                      process, with sensors on combines and tractors,                      irrigation, drainage ditches, water wells, not to mention                      remote sensing and aerial maps of fields. Food and fiber                      processing is similarly tracked to be able to pinpoint                      challenges in the system. All this data can feel like a                      real intrusion into agricultural producers' operations and                      lives. Precision agriculture provides opportunities for                      better management, but also poses risks to our food system                      due to cybersecurity attacks.                                          “Toward a Disaster Resilient California: Cultivating                        Data Security Practices in Precision Agriculture,” a California Council on Science & Technology (CCST)                      expert briefing on precision agricultural and best                      practices in data security addressed these issues.                      Facilitated by UC Irvine Vice Chancellor for Research                      Pramod Khargonekar, the panel covered several components                      along the data supply chain and the risks.                                          University of California, Merced professor                      Lisa Yeo, a cybersecurity and infrastructure expert in the School                      of Engineering's Management of Complex Systems department,                      provided expert commentary and recommendations on private                      and secure data focused on the producers and users of the                      data and information.                                          Prof. Yeo started by defining agriculture and our food                      supply as critical infrastructure and that it “needs to be                      protected in the same way as other infrastructure.”                                          “We have this habit as engineers of solving problems but                      not thinking of the whole systems. Inasmuch as we're                      creating agriculture internet of things devices, from                      sensors to connected tractors, we have to think about the                      best practices of designing with security in mind, and                      very much do that in places where we have critical                      infrastructure,” Yeo said. As a member of the NSF                      Engineering Research Center                      IoT4Ag                      and                      CITRIS-affiliated faculty, she continued, “In the IoT space, we                      have seen a lot of small devices that have poor                      design—default passwords, no passwords, difficulty                      changing them—that have been used in attacks elsewhere.”                                          Regarding ransomware, “I think when you look at it, it's                      going to depend on the timing and where in the chain it                      happens.” Yeo drew an analogy between attacks on gas                      stations versus                      oil pipelines, “It's not necessarily on the small farm where                      ransomware is going to have an immediate impact on our                      food supply because there's still a farmer there who can                      still do the work… But if you start scaling up within the                      supply chain and in the production process, then we start                      to see challenges.”                                          “A typical user wants to use the tool to solve the problem                      they have. They don't want to become experts in how all                      the pieces come together and work.” The goal then for                      designers and researchers changes to “how to make it easy                      for them to do their jobs in a safe and secure way. And                      that's a very complex activity.”                                          Yeo concluded “We have to think about the best practices                      of designing with security in mind.”                                          CCST hosted the panel on the premise that to feed a                      growing population affordably and in a way that minimizes                      greenhouse gas production, the farming industry will need                      to rely on innovative technologies such as precision                      agriculture. The panel explored broadly explore the                      benefits of precision agriculture and the susceptibility                      of its data to theft or corruption, and the potential                      impacts of losing those data.

As an undergraduate studying mechanical engineering, I                      have studied the emission rates and the overall                      inefficiencies within the diesel cycle. Seeing what I                      study being applied to real world scenarios was not only                      motivating but made me question personal career choices.                      CITRIS is a fully functioning research unit with the                      University of California, Merced with heavy student driven                      initiatives. CITRIS here at UC Merced addresses                      California’s most pressing societal and environmental                      problems by leveraging cutting-edge technologies,                      developing novel research, and conducting inspiring                      outreach. These research exchange events gave Dr. de                      Castro a platform to show all the challenging work he has                      done on advancing electric propulsion within agriculture.                                          In his talk, Dr. de Castro discusses how an electric                      powertrain has efficiencies greater than 90% while its                      diesel counterpart sits anywhere from 35-45% efficient. As                      explained by the automobile company,                      Kia, a powertrain is “an assembly of every component that                      pushes your vehicle forward."" Most inefficiency stems from                      friction and the heat generated during operations.                      Additionally, Electric powertrains also provide a quieter                      operation environment while the diesel powertrains are                      loud enough that the CDC says, “if an individual exposed                      to such an environment for even five minutes. The said                      individual is susceptible to permanent hearing damage and                      loss.” Dr. de Castro elaborated on maintenance between the                      two powertrains and the electric option comes out on top                      as the cheaper alternative. With all these overwhelming                      stats it poses the question; why are not all tractors                      electric already? Dr. de Castro explains that there are a                      few major limitations with electric.                                          Diesel powertrains are overall more efficient when it                      comes to harder and longer days whereas electric is only                      most viable in light work scenarios. This is in part to                      the size of battery, the cost of recharging, and the cost                      of a battery replacement. There is a limit of how big the                      battery can be because if it is too large the tractor                      could have a gross weight large enough that damages the                      soil because of the pressure induced by the tractor. As it                      stands currently, farms also do not have the                      infrastructure to support the charging of batteries.                                          However, Dr. de Castro gave multiple options and scenarios                      to combat the challenges of electric farm vehicles.                      Cutting the standard operation time down from eight hours                      to just four hours a day would make electric more viable –                      primarily since the load of a four-hour day is much less                      than that of an eight-hour day. Farmers are already                      looking for ways to reduce operation times to help lower                      fuel costs. Dr. de Castro adds that the cost to recharge                      these batteries is getting cheaper. Soon the price                      difference between gas and electricity will be cost                      effective enough to start utilizing electric tractors. In                      my opinion, the most important development is that only                      0.5% of the crop area here in California needs to be                      covered in solar panels to produce enough power to support                      all the tractors here in California.                                          Dr. Castro acknowledges that these new concepts and                      technology are challenging to implement. However, he has                      been developing comparison matrixes with simulations that                      will help the everyday farmer pick the right tractor                      fleet. Whether that is diesel, electric or even a hybrid.                                          For those interested, Dr. de Castro’s presentation is                      uploaded to the                      CITRIS                      YouTube channel for everyone to see.                    ",

For many, AAM brings to mind headlines about companies using drones to                                    drop packages on people’s doorsteps, but the field involves a wide array of transit                                    niches and emerging technologies, with applications in passenger mobility, freight                                    delivery and emergency response.AAM requires the creation of new air corridors, or mapped pathways through which                                    vehicles can safely travel. The establishment and regulation of these corridors                                    requires careful planning, especially in areas that already have busy skies and                                    crowded streets.The Caltrans project focuses on urban air mobility (UAM), which involves flight                                    traffic in densely populated areas and often includes passenger travel, and also                                    addresses flights that move cargo too large to be carried by drones.Sengupta and team are approaching the project from both quantitative and qualitative                                    angles. The first track, led by Bayen, concentrates on the digital tools needed to                                    create an accurate simulation of UAM, including potential air corridors, safety                                    issues and environmental impacts. While the skies of the Bay Area will serve as                                    their case study, the tool set will be suitable for use across the state of                                    California — and beyond.The second track, led by Shaheen, aims to better understand the needs of key                                    stakeholders, such as government agencies, regulators and corporations, and will                                    produce briefs and manuals for stakeholders intending to implement AAM in their                                    regions.Assessing noise and safety concernsThe aircraft used for AAM will vary by cargo and travel requirements, but they are                                    generally expected to be hybrid or electric vehicles that generate fewer emissions                                    than traditional airplanes. Multirotor systems will likely proliferate due to their                                    vertical take-off and landing capabilities, as well as their overall versatility.                                “Many people compare the UAM noise of rotating propellers to a helicopter,” Lee said.                                    “Helicopters are so loud that they can’t fly in urban areas. Urban air mobility will                                    be quieter because urban aircraft blades will be shorter, and noise is proportional                                    to tip speed.“However, air taxis will have multiple air rotors. They will also fly at lower                                    altitudes than helicopters do. As a result, noise pollution may still be an issue.”                                Lee will use UCD-QuietFly, software that he developed to predict noise pollution,  to                                                                             create a “noise map.”  This assessment will account for the number of                                    aircraft in the area, the heights of nearby buildings and the amount of noise                                    generated by each aircraft, to give policymakers an idea how AAM noise will compare                                    to ground traffic.The dangers associated with AAM extend beyond noise pollution, however, and include                                    risks to passengers, the public, and people who maintain equipment and facilities.                                    As ​​director of the UC Center of Excellence on Unmanned Aircraft System Safety,                                    Stark is an expert on aircraft safety, particularly the autonomous or                                    semi-autonomous uncrewed vehicle systems, aka UASs or drones, that are likely to                                    constitute the bulk of AAM fleets.Using existing research from NASA, the international Joint Authorities for Rulemaking                                    on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and other agencies, Stark will identify key metrics and                                    analytic tools to provide meaningful safety data for future policymakers.“This simulation will be useful to make good policy decisions,” Stark said. “We have                                    to understand what advanced air mobility means for our community so that we can give                                    this information to local governments.”Laying strong groundworkThe researchers intend to incorporate stakeholder input from beginning to end.                                    Shaheen, co-director of the UC Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research                                    Center (TSRC) and a pioneer in future mobility strategies, will lead the effort to                                    conduct expert interviews to determine the information that planning and policy                                    staff, regulators, and agencies will need to enable AAM.“The goal is to foster shared understanding of roles and responsibilities and develop                                    best practices for the development and approval of AAM corridors,” Shaheen said.This track of research will also include group discussions with stakeholders,                                    workshops to review the simulation’s progress and the production of policy briefs                                    for stakeholders to use for their AAM implementations.While the team will lay a strong qualitative and quantitative foundation for the                                    adoption of advanced air mobility adoption in California, they do not expect to                                    address every concern related to such a complex topic.“There are energy issues, charging issues, environmental issues,” Sengupta said. “But                                    our project doesn’t have to solve these problems. We must instead innovate the                                    processes and tools the planners will use to solve them.”",

While the skies of the Bay Area will serve as                                    their case study, the tool set will be suitable for use across the state of                                    California — and beyond.The second track, led by Shaheen, aims to better understand the needs of key                                    stakeholders, such as government agencies, regulators and corporations, and will                                    produce briefs and manuals for stakeholders intending to implement AAM in their                                    regions.Assessing noise and safety concernsThe aircraft used for AAM will vary by cargo and travel requirements, but they are                                    generally expected to be hybrid or electric vehicles that generate fewer emissions                                    than traditional airplanes. Multirotor systems will likely proliferate due to their                                    vertical take-off and landing capabilities, as well as their overall versatility.                                “Many people compare the UAM noise of rotating propellers to a helicopter,” Lee said.                                    “Helicopters are so loud that they can’t fly in urban areas. Urban air mobility will                                    be quieter because urban aircraft blades will be shorter, and noise is proportional                                    to tip speed.“However, air taxis will have multiple air rotors. They will also fly at lower                                    altitudes than helicopters do. As a result, noise pollution may still be an issue.”                                Lee will use UCD-QuietFly, software that he developed to predict noise pollution,  to                                                                             create a “noise map.”  This assessment will account for the number of                                    aircraft in the area, the heights of nearby buildings and the amount of noise                                    generated by each aircraft, to give policymakers an idea how AAM noise will compare                                    to ground traffic.The dangers associated with AAM extend beyond noise pollution, however, and include                                    risks to passengers, the public, and people who maintain equipment and facilities.                                    As ​​director of the UC Center of Excellence on Unmanned Aircraft System Safety,                                    Stark is an expert on aircraft safety, particularly the autonomous or                                    semi-autonomous uncrewed vehicle systems, aka UASs or drones, that are likely to                                    constitute the bulk of AAM fleets.Using existing research from NASA, the international Joint Authorities for Rulemaking                                    on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and other agencies, Stark will identify key metrics and                                    analytic tools to provide meaningful safety data for future policymakers.“This simulation will be useful to make good policy decisions,” Stark said. “We have                                    to understand what advanced air mobility means for our community so that we can give                                    this information to local governments.”Laying strong groundworkThe researchers intend to incorporate stakeholder input from beginning to end.                                    Shaheen, co-director of the UC Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research                                    Center (TSRC) and a pioneer in future mobility strategies, will lead the effort to                                    conduct expert interviews to determine the information that planning and policy                                    staff, regulators, and agencies will need to enable AAM.“The goal is to foster shared understanding of roles and responsibilities and develop                                    best practices for the development and approval of AAM corridors,” Shaheen said.This track of research will also include group discussions with stakeholders,                                    workshops to review the simulation’s progress and the production of policy briefs                                    for stakeholders to use for their AAM implementations.While the team will lay a strong qualitative and quantitative foundation for the                                    adoption of advanced air mobility adoption in California, they do not expect to                                    address every concern related to such a complex topic.“There are energy issues, charging issues, environmental issues,” Sengupta said. “But                                    our project doesn’t have to solve these problems. We must instead innovate the                                    processes and tools the planners will use to solve them.”",

With UC Merced’s Mobile Maker Lab as headquarters, the                      CITRIS team taught young people to write simple programs                      in introductory Python to make drones fly a pattern — a                      new curriculum unit developed by Gamiño and Peter Sou                      (’22) who will graduate in May with a computer science and                      engineering degree.

The robots                      are routinely used to inspire middle schoolers in Merced                      about robotics and coding.

Other drought-affected areas                                    include the Russian River Basin and intermountain agricultural areas in Siskiyou,                                    Shasta and Modoc counties. The crops most significantly affected by increased                                    fallowing include rice in the Sacramento Valley, cotton in the San Joaquin Valley,                                    and grain and field crops statewide.“In comparison with the 2012-2016 drought, conditions were much worse for the                                    Sacramento Valley and the Russian River Basin, yet the statewide impacts have not                                    been as severe as in 2015 — the deepest point in the last drought,” said School of Engineering Professor Josué                                        Medellín-Azuara, lead author of the report. “Should dry conditions persist                                    throughout 2022, a higher tier of adaptation measures may come into play to reduce                                    economic impacts on agriculture and communities that host thousands of households                                    relying on agriculture for a living.”The report also highlights strong commodity prices that have helped mitigate some                                    economic costs of the 2021 drought. Milk prices rose because of global demand,                                    raising revenues and offsetting some of the drought-related effects of higher                                    production costs. The dairy sector also explored alternatives to hay and winter                                    grains that, in some cases, increased cow milk productivity. The beef cattle sector                                    also had to adapt to scarce winter pastures and higher forage prices, but the                                    state’s beef cow herd increased, as did its share of the national cow herd, leading                                    to potential revenue gains.While Californians are familiar with drought, the 2020-21 water years were the second                                    driest two years on record. Although precipitation deficits were widespread, drought                                    conditions were more severe in the Sacramento Valley and the North Coast regions.

Warmer                                    temperatures and already-dry conditions increased crop irrigation demands and                                    widened                                    the gap between water supply and irrigation needs.“Warming has impacted seasonal water availability, namely through reducing spring                                    snowmelt runoff and through increasing atmospheric thirst,” said Professor  John Abatzoglou,                                    climate expert and co-author in the report. “These factors in concert have                                    intensified                                    drought severity and impacts in the state and increased the need for actionable                                    solutions to cope with drought.”The drought hit during the early implementation of Sustainable Groundwater Management                                    Act                                    (SGMA) sustainability plans. The Act is designed to avoid the undesirable                                    consequences                                    of unsustainable groundwater use. Groundwater sustainability plans for critically                                    overdrafted basins were submitted in 2020 and plans in other priority basins are due                                    early this year. These plans remain in progress throughout the state for these and                                    other                                    priority basins. California’s increasingly variable supply of surface water and                                    overdrafted groundwater aquifers present serious challenges for meeting societal                                    needs,                                    the report points out.“It is no surprise that California leans more heavily on groundwater to help meet its                                    water supply needs during drought. SGMA is now well underway, and it is shaping how                                    we                                    respond to drought, especially in the Valley. Despite the very real economic impact,                                    this report also indicates an enormous capacity for innovation and adaptation in the                                    agricultural industry, not limited to augmenting cattle feed with almond hulls                                    —typically a byproduct — and also direct investments in aquifer recharge techniques                                    and                                    technologies,” said report co-author                                         Professor Joshua Viers.                                    “These innovations, coupled with better information about water application and use,                                    will ultimately help us manage scarce water supplies more effectively.”Funded by a $1.5 million research grant from the                                         California Department of Food and Agriculture, Medellín-Azuara, Abatzoglou,                                    Viers and Escriva-Bou have worked since last fall to develop this economic analysis,                                    along with decision-support tools for the agriculture industry during droughts.

Learn more about the Nextech Robotics program by clicking the image above.,"                      University of California, Merced-- Second-year Mechanical                      Engineering student Lina B-Hernandez had a different                      experience than many young people growing up in the San                      Joaquin Valley. “As a middle school student, I learned to                      do hands-on activities with robotics and coding. This                      opened my eyes to the many opportunities that I would have                      in the future, and as a NexTech educator I hope to bring                      that same feeling to the middle school students.” Despite                      being two hours drive from Silicon Valley, an innovation                      hub of technology, Lina's school in Madera offering                      robotics is an exception rather than the rule.                    NexTech Robotics program make STEM cool and accessible                        with creative coding curriculum (Credit: CITRIS)                      The Center for Information Technology Research in the                      Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute (CITRIS) at                      UC Merced started the program in 2015 and has delivered                      high-quality equipment and experiences with technology via                      the NexTech Robotics program. The program was started by                      an outstanding alumna Alexus Garcia who built it from                      scratch based on the robot kits, working with schools to                      fulfill their afterschool needs and student interests.                                          The curriculum covers major topics of coding, design, and                      the interaction between hardware and software to perform a                      specific task, otherwise known as an embedded system.                      NexTech is continually adapting and introducing new                      curriculum to cover topics of 3-D visualization and design                      and the versatile computer language, Python.                                          Peter Sou is spending his last year at UC Merced building                      new units of curriculum on Python before joining the                      ag-tech workforce. ""It's a very versatile and                      beginner-friendly language that can open up different                      avenues including web development, AI, and data science.""                      Typically, the robots are programmed in a block or Scratch                      style of coding—a drag and drop format—but Python affords                      the students to see the next steps ahead of them.                      Previous educators have built units on drones, remote                      sensing, and HTML.                                          UC Merced students serve as mentors and illustrate a                      pathway to success in higher education. That’s what                      matters most to Mechanical Engineering student Paul                      Conanan who said that “Being a NexTech Educator allows me                      to give back to my community and hopefully inspire a new                      generation of students.”                                          Thanks to support from                      AgAID,                      the NSF-USDA funded AI Institute for Transforming                      Workforce & Decision Support program, and                      Siemens, NexTech has continued to expand and to serve more                      students in the region, even during the learn-from-home                      time in 2021.                                          CITRIS UC Merced Director Joshua Viers said, “Since its                      inception, NexTech has embodied what is best about UC                      Merced and its students and our community. NexTech                      provides not only opportunities for local middle schoolers                      to learn about cool new tech and how to build and program                      robots – useful skills in our digital age – but also                      provides opportunities for UC Merced students to learn                      something about themselves as they share their knowledge                      and experiences with the soon-to-be next generation of                      tech leaders from the San Joaquin Valley.”                                          Students assemble the “ClawBot” to prepare for coding with                      sensors.

Some promising                                            mitigation and adaptation strategies include improving flood management to                                            serve ecosystems and replenishing groundwater aquifers when water is                                            available. The wide adoption of carbon-neutral technologies and                                            electrification of vehicles will contribute to better air quality, say the                                            authors. The key solution from the UC Merced authors is                                            focusing on at-risk communities and the capacity to change the situation for                                            multiple benefits.

The San Joaquin Valley report highlights what investments will                                            help us all adapt to climate change,” Fernandez-Bou said. “The agricultural                                            identity of the Valley can become an important asset for mitigation and                                            adaptation strategies, and to promote environmental and socioeconomic                                            justice — if some regenerative-agriculture practices are incentivized with                                            adequate policies.”The team identified major climate-linked negative                                            impacts for communities, agriculture, ecosystems and infrastructure that                                            will affect most aspects of life in the San Joaquin Valley. The key findings of the report illustrate the complex                                            nature of climate change impacts on a water-limited area. Increasing temperatures have a drying effect by                                            evaporating more water, and warmer weather also means many storms will be                                            warmer and wetter and more concentrated in fewer months during the winter.                                            Valley water resources will swing between flooding events and prolonged                                            droughts with increased groundwater pumping. Dry soils, forests and communities will fuel the                                            severity and extent of wildfires, as well as lengthening fire season,                                            impacting air quality for many months. Climate change does not affect all Californians                                            equally. Those without sufficient resources — economic, infrastructure and                                            frontline communities in general — will be disproportionally hit. Air                                            quality and human health impacts due to climate change are more pronounced                                            in rural disadvantaged communities of the San Joaquin Valley than in the                                            rest of California. These populations are more likely to experience more                                            heat-related deaths and illnesses, deteriorating air and water quality, and                                            general lower quality of life and decreased potential for livelihoods. Some                                            intensive agricultural practices and unplanned development on the San                                            Joaquin Valley may also exacerbate negative impacts of climate change,                                            furthering habitat loss for native species and the establishment of invasive                                            species.“Some of the most economically valuable commodities                                            are threatened by some early climate change effects,” the Climate Change                                            Assessment says. Fewer winter chill hours will affect many of the productive                                            orchards throughout the Valley and foothills, and all agricultural                                            production will be affected by water availability, increased evaporative                                            demands and extreme heat. Reduced crop yields and changes in timing of                                            cropping systems may affect the regional economy and employment.                                        “Multi-benefit and inclusive approaches to                                            strategically repurpose land in the San Joaquin Valley and increasing                                            climate resilience are worth pursuing to ensure a habitable and thriving                                            area,” Medellín-Azuara said. “But agriculture, communities and ecosystems in                                            the San Joaquin Valley can coexist sustainably if the state’s plans are                                            comprehensive and include mitigation and adaptation.”                                ",

Her interdisciplinary contributions to the field of human-robot                                        interaction include the co-creation of improved robot design and best practices                                        guidelines for human-robot interactions. Among research endeavors spanning disciplines and even continents, Ahumada is the                                        principal investigator of a $1 million-dollar NSF National Robotics Initiative                                        (NRI) grant to create better educational robots for children who are restricted                                        to their homes due to medical conditions or disabilities. She is also a                                        co-investigator on a $1.2 million UC Multicampus Research Project to create                                        telemanipulation robots to help protect health care workers and increase social                                        inclusion for people at high risk of infection. In addition to technical innovation, Ahumada has demonstrated leadership in                                        diversity, equity and inclusion. She was the first female PI of an NRI grant at                                        UC Irvine and then at UC Davis. She is a member of an all-female team studying                                        telerobots to increase health care worker safety and reduce isolation for older                                        adults. She also founded the Latino Excellence and Achievement Awards at UC                                        Irvine to celebrate academic achievement and raise awareness of the                                        underrepresentation of Latine scholars in STEM. Ahumada is a first-generation Mexican American scholar. As a Latina professor                                        from the United States, she is part of only 1 percent of the UC STEM                                        professoriate — even though Latines are the largest population group in                                        California.

The team is advised by UC Merced’s                      YangQuan Chen, professor of mechanical engineering, and                      Spencer Castro, assistant professor of management of complex systems.                                          The demonstration will be conducted at the                      UC Merced Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve, a 6,500-acre nature preserve adjacent to campus that is                      part of the                      UC Natural Reserve System. The site restricts access to permitted visitors only                      and offers a generous amount of uncontrolled Class G                      airspace, making it an ideal location both to mitigate                      risk associated with the test flight and to approximate                      real-world research conditions.                                          “I’m looking forward to seeing this project in active                      development,” said                      Brandon Stark, the director of the                      UC Center of Excellence on Unmanned Aircraft System                        Safety                      and a research assistant professor of mechanical                      engineering at UC Merced who has played a key role in                      creating the CITRIS Aviation Prize. “There are a lot of                      pieces to integrate in only six months, such as autonomous                      safe landing site selection and 4/5G communication, on top                      of a unique hybrid vertical take-off and landing platform,                      but I’m confident this team is up to the challenge.”                                          CITRIS Director                      Costas Spanos                      praised all seven proposals submitted. “It is inspiring to                      see such innovation and enthusiasm from student teams                      across the four CITRIS campuses to meet the high bar                      established for this inaugural challenge,” he said. “We                      look forward to bringing together talent to see a                      successful flight in the spring and inspire more                      engagement from students and faculty in the future.”                                          While the Project LEAP-FROG team will lead the spring                      demo, CITRIS invites faculty, staff and the other Aviation                      Prize competitors to help make the flight a success.

Competitive teams from the                      University of California campuses                      at Berkeley, Davis, Davis Health, Merced and Santa Cruz                      submitted 47 proposals for innovative, early-stage                      projects that emphasize collaboration across two or more                      institutions. This year, thanks in part to external                      philanthropic support, 13 teams were selected to each                      receive a one-time award of up to $60,000 for                      interdisciplinary work. These projects are designed to                      show results within a year, but many promise far-reaching                      influence on the future of their fields.                                          “We are proud to support these innovative                      multidisciplinary proposals that demonstrate not only the                      bold ideas of UC faculty members but the power of forging                      partnerships across campuses to advance technology                      solutions for some of the most pressing issues of our                      day,” said CITRIS Director                      Costas Spanos.                                          The selected proposals address grand challenges, including                      climate resilience, digital health innovation,                      next-generation technology policy, and automation and the                      workforce. Wildfire mitigation and decision support was a                      common theme: One project proposes using a swarm of                      uncrewed aerial vehicles to detect wildfires earlier,                      while others aim to protect civilians with air quality                      monitoring, robust building materials and safety training.                      Other projects will leverage machine learning and the                      Internet of Things (IoT) to offer human-centered solutions                      to clean energy, water management and advanced health care                      issues.                                          Just as their proposals tackle critical problems in                      innovative ways, the teams feature faculty members from                      diverse fields. The investigators’ backgrounds range from                      mechanical and aerospace engineering to architecture,                      ophthalmology and management of complex systems. More than                      half the projects include pre-tenure faculty, and 85                      percent of this year’s lead investigators are new CITRIS                      Seed Award recipients.                                           Since 2008, the                      CITRIS Seed Funding                      program has supported more than 235 projects and over 425                      researchers, resulting in extramural funding up to four                      times the initial investment within three years of                      completion. CITRIS Seed Awards facilitate the scientific                      groundwork, data collection and prototyping necessary to                      pursue larger research or commercialization awards that                      address major unsolved challenges.                    The following proposals received 2021 awards:Air-drag-reducing microstructured surfaces (ARMS) for                        improved fuel efficiencyPrincipal Investigators: Grace Gu (Lead PI, UC                      Berkeley), Stephen Robinson (UC Davis)                                          Skin friction drag, i.e., air drag due to friction against                      surfaces, reduces the energy efficiency of various                      technologies, including aircraft, wind turbines and gas                      pipelines. These applications contribute up to 3.5 percent                      of total global carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing                      their fuel efficiency by even 1 percent could save over                      180 million gallons of fossil fuel per year.  This                      project intends to create a synthetic surface inspired by                      shark skin, a material that has been proven to reduce                      friction drag when compared to a smooth surface. Covering                      airplane panels, wind turbine blades and gas pipelines                      with this novel material could significantly decrease the                      amount of energy needed to power their use and have a                      positive impact on emissions.                    Auditing the compliance of California consumer privacy                        regulations at scalePrincipal Investigators: Serge Egelman (Lead PI, UC                      Berkeley), Zubair Shafiq (UC Davis)                                          The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides                      enhanced privacy protections and rights for California                      residents. Enacted in 2018, the CCPA allows consumers to                      request information about how a business collects, uses                      and discloses their personal information, and to withdraw                      their consent from the sale of personal data. This project                      will examine the implementation of these new regulations                      to learn how well application developers understand their                      obligations and create processes for consumers to exercise                      their rights. The study will also investigate the accuracy                      of companies’ responses to these requests and the                      effectiveness of consent mechanisms. The findings of this                      research can help legal entities strengthen consumer                      rights and could generate tools for developers to ensure                      their apps meet CCPA standards.                    Automated wearable ophthalmic imaging devicePrincipal Investigators: Parisa Emami Naeini (Lead                      PI, UC Davis Health), Iman Soltani (UC Davis)                                          Vision impairment is one of the most common disabilities                      worldwide, yet most cases can be prevented through regular                      eye exams and advanced ocular imaging. However, current                      imaging technologies are expensive and bulky, require                      skilled technicians to operate, and cannot accommodate a                      diverse range of patient needs and abilities. As a result,                      many people — such as children and the elderly, those in                      remote regions and those from lower socioeconomic                      backgrounds — don’t have access to vision-saving                      technology. This project will develop an automated                      wearable ophthalmic imaging device, consisting of a                      virtual reality headset with fundus imaging and optical                      coherence tomography systems. Patients will see                      entertaining visual stimuli while receiving vital                      diagnostic care. The instrument is intended to be operable                      in any setting, and will increase equitable access to                      medical technologies across socioeconomic statuses and                      geographic areas.                    Clearing the air: Using smart thermostats to improve                        wildfire resiliency in Californian homesPrincipal Investigators: Stefano Schiavon (Lead PI,                      UC Berkeley), Mark Modera (UC Davis)                                          Fine particulate matter is the largest environmental risk                      factor for human health and death in California, and                      wildfires in the western United States are a major source.                      Exposure studies have largely focused on outdoor                      particulate concentrations, but people tend to shelter                      indoors during fire events. This project will develop                      software that programs smart thermostats to adjust                      ventilation system operation based on outdoor particulate                      concentrations, in order to ensure indoor air quality.                      Using this technology, smart thermostats can reduce air                      intake in occupied buildings when outdoor air quality is                      poor and use air quality forecasts to precondition homes                      to reduce peak cooling loads. This project not only                      decreases the health risks associated with wildfires, but                      also sets the groundwork for future efforts to use big                      data to improve public health and climate resilience.                    Developing resilient materials and sensors for improved                        building performancePrincipal Investigators: Lilian Davila (Lead PI, UC                      Merced), Jeanette Cobian-Iñiguez (UC Merced), Scott Moura                      (UC Berkeley)                                          Climate change is increasingly affecting communities                      around the world through more intense and frequent                      wildfires, extensive flooding, and other natural                      disasters. This project will design, fabricate and test                      new eco-friendly, fire-resistant construction materials,                      as well as low-cost, integrated environmental sensors to                      measure their performance. The design process will inform                      the future development, testing and implementation of                      similar building materials and monitoring devices while                      also promoting sustainable materials and reuse of industry                      waste. If the materials generated by this project prove to                      be fire-resistant, thermally insulating and structurally                      robust, they could establish a path away from steel, a key                      construction component that greatly contributes to carbon                      dioxide emissions.                     Electric tractors: Identifying paths to clean energy in                        farming operationsPrincipal Investigators: Ricardo Pinto de Castro                      (Lead PI, UC Merced), Reza Ehsani (UC Merced), Stavros                      Vougioukas (UC Davis)                                          Almost all agricultural vehicles in current use rely on                      fossil fuels, one of the main sources of air pollutants.                      Electrification is a long-term solution to this problem,                      but to date, electric tractors have cost more, required                      more infrastructure and worked fewer hours per charge than                      their diesel counterparts. This project will develop a                      tool to help farm managers determine when to deploy the                      electric and diesel tractors in their fleets. This                      decision tool relies on data collected from the farm, such                      as acreage, crop types, soil and weather patterns, to                      compute overall power requirements for the fleet.                      Optimization techniques will help characterize an ideal                      balance between technical performance, economic costs and                      air pollution. The resulting information can help                      stakeholders in agriculture develop electrification                      strategies and ultimately create more sustainable                      systems.                     Haptic smart phone-cover: A real-time navigation system                        for individuals with visual impairment Principal Investigators: Iman Soltani (Lead PI, UC                      Davis), Parisa Emami Naeini (UC Davis Health), Jonathon                      Schofield (UC Davis)                                          While many researchers have thoroughly investigated                      assistive technologies to help people with visual                      impairments navigate and experience their environments in                      rich detail, few devices have been adapted beyond research                      spaces. This project aims to take assistive aids out of                      the laboratory and into the world by creating a tactile                      phone cover to provide the user with a haptic map of                      surrounding obstacles using controllable surface                      topography. By relying on touch, rather than sound, this                      technology allows for people with visual impairments to be                      aware of their surroundings while also being able to sense                      their environment in richer detail. This technology can                      help individuals with visual impairments to move around                      their surroundings more independently and also inform                      further development of haptic assistive devices.                    Mapping the global use of water resources in                        agriculturePrincipal Investigators: Paolo D’Odorico                      (Lead PI, UC Berkeley), Andre Daccache (UC Davis)                                          Agriculture is responsible for roughly 70 percent of human                      water consumption, and growing populations require the                      production of more food — and thus the use of more water.                      However, due to climatic extremes and unpredictable water                      supplies, some regions must enhance crop yields with a                      more strategic, data-informed approach to water usage.                      This project will develop high-resolution spatial and                      temporal irrigation models for a global-scale water                      information system to replace commonly used but outdated                      global irrigation maps. This new system relies on                      satellite remote sensing and artificial intelligence, as                      well as global models of irrigation water needs, water                      availability and actual irrigation schemes. Powered by                      deep learning algorithms, the resulting models can inform                      policymakers, academic researchers and nongovernmental                      organizations to guide decisions on water management,                      investment and policy.                    Persistent, autonomous, patient-centered monitoring and                        its application to pressure injury preventionPrincipal Investigators: Katia Obraczka (Lead PI,                      UC Santa Cruz), Sarina Fazio (UC Davis Health), Holly                      Kirkland-Kyhn (UC Davis Health)                                          Low-mobility individuals are disproportionately affected                      by pressure ulcers and injuries, wounds that develop in                      localized areas of tissue and can take years to heal. This                      open-source project based on the Internet of Things (IoT)                      will integrate vital sign sensors and surfaces such as                      mattresses or wheelchairs into a patient monitoring                      framework. The resulting system is designed to operate                      autonomously and continuously, with real-time data                      collection, storage and analysis. Given the system’s                      ability to detect conditions early, its immediate visual                      feedback and its integration of different sensors based on                      a patient’s individual health conditions, this project has                      the potential to significantly improve telehealth                      treatment, patient well-being and health care costs.                    The power of health in Africa: A novel data collection                        approach for analyzing how distributed energy systems                        support vaccine cold chain resilience Principal Investigators: Daniel Kammen (Lead PI, UC                      Berkeley), Rebecca Hernandez (UC Davis)                                          Health care provisioning and basic services in the Global                      South rely heavily on affordable and reliable electricity,                      and a lack of data on power quality and reliability                      hinders efforts to address the temperature-dependent                      supply chain, or cold chain, of COVID-19 vaccines in                      Africa. By using outlet-level power sensors and a robust                      collection methodology, this project will systematically                      gather high-quality information on health centers’ uptime.                      Efforts will focus on locations in Rwanda and the                      Democratic Republic of the Congo and will characterize the                      energy needs at various scales of health services. By                      collecting and monitoring spatiotemporal data                      continuously, this project can help electrification                      planners better rationalize infrastructure deployments and                      assist health sector professionals in identifying cold                      chain vulnerabilities.                     Uncrewed aerial vehicle swarms for large-scale and                        real-time air toxin measurement near                        wildland-urban-interface firesPrincipal Investigators: Zhaodan Kong (Lead PI, UC                      Davis), Deborah Bennett (UC Davis Health), Anthony Wexler                      (UC Davis), Thomas Young (UC Davis)                                          While California has faced numerous hazardous wildfires in                      recent years, fires at the wildland-urban interface (WUI)                      are particularly dangerous, as they burn synthetic                      compounds that can make their smoke more toxic than                      wildland blazes. Currently, WUI fires can be only                      partially mitigated by human responders and the resulting                      smoke plumes are poorly understood while they travel                      across long distances. To provide support in the short                      term, this project will build and deploy a swarm of                      uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and use them to measure a                      range of toxic gases and aerosols in WUI plumes during                      active fire events. In the long-term, this research aims                      to develop UAV swarms that can autonomously assess fire                      risks, predict the transfer of outdoor pollutants into                      indoor environments, and better characterize the health                      effects of toxic wildfire plumes.                    Virtual evacuation decision-making under fire threat                        for personal property and transportation                        decisionsPrincipal Investigators: Spencer Castro (Lead PI,                      UC Merced), Sri Kurniawan (UC Santa Cruz)                                          Given the devastating breadth of wildfires across 12                      states in 2020, and the increasing prevalence of fires in                      locations with historically lower danger, more people are                      being exposed to fires at the wildland-urban interface                      (WUI). Many people in these locations are unaware of the                      dangers of wildfires and unprepared to evacuate their                      homes. This project plans to develop a platform for public                      fire training through immersive virtual environments for                      greater accessibility and evacuation decision-making under                      time pressure. The platform will help determine which                      sensory metrics best predict performance for these types                      of decisions and accurately represent real-time cognition.                      This technology will help civilians evacuate their homes                      more efficiently and, ultimately, help save lives.                     Wearable sensor technologies for continuous monitoring                        of function and capacity in older adultsPrincipal Investigators: Carolynn Patten (Lead PI,                      UC Davis Health), Xin Liu (UC Davis)                                          While continuous monitoring technology that can help older                      adults identify changes in their functional ability and                      physiological capacity has become more common in recent                      years, no wearable devices are yet commercially available                      to measure step symmetry. Step symmetry is an important                      early indicator of health conditions that may leave older                      adults unable to live independently. To encourage                      proactive care for these problems, this project will                      combine a wearable sensor with an algorithm for heart                      rate, acceleration and gyroscope signals to determine                      critical changes in a patient’s gait. Observing these                      changes early can improve life planning for older people                      and can offer hope for remediation with timely, targeted                      intervention programs to maintain physical, cognitive and                      emotional health.

Photo by Veronica Adrover.                      Students at UC Merced and those who might someday become                      Bobcats are the focus of FARMERS,                                              Professor Rudy M. Ortiz’s                      training program funded again for $1 million by the U.S.                      Department of Agriculture (USDA).                                          FARMERS stands for Facilitating Agriculture-Related                      Mentoring for Emerging Research Scholars, and the goal is                      to train 15 undergraduate and 10 graduate students a year                      over the next four years to conduct in-depth research into                      agriculture-related subjects.                                          “Agriculture as a subject has many layers. It’s not all                      about being a farmer,” Ortiz said. “There are many                      opportunities for other kinds of research, including                      economics, engineering, math, sustainability and more.                      There will be opportunities that students might not                      otherwise have explored.”                                          For example, though Ortiz is a physiologist with the                                              Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, much of his research revolves around nutrition.                                          The USDA’s Education Collaborative program for                      Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) has awarded Ortiz and                      his lab                      this competitive and prestigious grant at this funding                      level twice, as well as a third, smaller one. It’s                      especially relevant in the San Joaquin Valley, of course,                      because not only is this one of the nation’s most                      disadvantaged regions, it’s also one of the most diverse                      areas of California, and one of the most agriculturally                      rich.                                          Besides professional development and research training,                      FARMERS offers students opportunities for internships,                      networking and outreach to younger students by helping                      develop curriculum that will prepare children for college                      and studies in the science, technology, engineering and                      math (STEM) fields.                                          “We’re also expanding the number and type of research                      training opportunities to the diverse population of                      students supported by UC Merced and our partner HSIs, CSU                      Stanislaus and UC Santa Cruz and others,” Ortiz said.                                          Melisa Quintana, an Earth systems sciences major who                      expects to graduate in the spring, is a FARMERS                      participant. She’s interested in soil health in                      agroecological systems, nutrient cycling in natural                      ecosystems, conservation and regeneration of biodiversity,                      land defense, food sovereignty, social justice and climate                      resiliency. She is researching how soil health amendments,                      specifically the addition of biochar and compost, can                      improve soil quality and increase carbon sequestration in                      conventional systems and how soil health practices reduce                      greenhouse gas emissions at dairy farms.                                          Though she did a little bit of experimentation in grade                      school science classes, once she got to college, her                      interest grew, and she joined FARMERS, working with                                              Professor Rebecca Ryals, an affiliated faculty member.                                          “I was amazed that you could research topics like the                      spatial distribution of species over time, changes in                      species abundance and diversity, soil health practices,                      integrating sustainable agriculture practices and more,”                      she said. “After this exposure to different types of                      research and researchers, I was hooked.”                                          As a first-generation Guatemalan American, Quintana said                      the research she has learned about brought her to some                      surprising conclusions.                                          “I hadn’t known that most of the soil health amendment                      practices we're integrating to reduce greenhouse gas                      emissions and increase carbon sequestration stem from                      Indigenous knowledge and peasant farming practices,” she                      said. “It was even more surprising when I was talking to                      my mother, a Guatemalan Campesina, about my work and she                      mentioned that she has implemented the farming methods I'm                      learning about on our family's land growing up. I didn't                      realize how connected my family and I are to the land.”                                          FARMERS is not only for Hispanic students, even though it                      is part of the HSI program. Over the seven years it has                      been funded, FARMERS has helped more than 50 students go                      on to graduate programs and ag-related careers. All                      FARMERS students have graduated, and Ortiz said he plans                      that the next group of participants will maintain that                      perfect record.                                          The students will work on peer-reviewed publications,                      attend conferences and meetings and be able to join a                      summer ag institute next year. They will also have                      opportunities to meet and discuss career opportunities                      with USDA representatives at meetings and on campus.                                          “It will be good for students to learn more about the                      USDA, the way the agency interacts with society and the                      kinds of career possibilities it offers,” Ortiz said.

Incremental water management and institutional learning at                      all levels have provided building blocks to better manage                      water shortages.                                          But California is the largest agricultural producer in the                      nation, generating more than $50 billion in commodity                      gross revenue in 2019. Farms underpin the economy of much                      of rural California, and the state’s nearly 70,000 farmers                      and ranchers produce more than 400 agricultural                      commodities, according to the state’s budget report.                                          Agriculture is threatened by the effects of climate                      change, including extreme climate events such as droughts                      and floods, increases in pests and stressed ecosystems.                      The COVID-19 pandemic and emerging drought conditions have                      disrupted the food supply chain and created additional                      challenges for the agricultural sector. To address these                      challenges, farmers and ranchers continue to innovate by                      adopting agile technology, expanding in local and global                      markets, and developing sustainable, climate-smart                      agricultural practices, the state said.                                          At the same time, communities connected to agriculture                      share, to varying extents, multi-year drought impacts such                      as water shortages and high temperatures and their                      lingering effects, including dry wells, increased fire                      risk, and degraded air and water quality.                                          Some promising avenues point to flexible allocation                      schemes, managed aquifer recharge, coordinated operation                      of surface and water reserves and conveyance, and                      institutional reforms such as the 2014 Sustainable                      Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) to preserve the state’s                      most valuable buffer during droughts.                                          The researchers will enhance cloud-based collaborative                      modeling tools to assess drought impacts and promising                      adaptations. This will facilitate collaboration among                      agencies, academics and other stakeholders to identify                      drought vulnerabilities, and provide policy                      recommendations for ongoing and future droughts.                                          “Our goal is to advance state-level drought early-warning                      systems to give decision-makers opportunities to mitigate                      drought impacts,” Abatzoglou said. “It wasn’t a question                      of if there will be another multi-year drought like the                      San Joaquin Valley endured in 2012-2016, it was a matter                      of when — and here we are. Our goals are to use data and                      decisions to improve drought outcomes for these events.”                                          Policy and decision makers will be able to better                      understand the impacts of drought — with distributional                      effects — on disadvantaged communities and the potential                      for dry wells.                                          “By developing tools to understand the consequences of our                      management actions, we will be able to inform policy                      decisions to improve socio-economic outcomes, and to avoid                      undesirable consequences on vulnerable communities,”                      Escriva-Bou said.                                          Besides the economic assessment of drought impacts, the                      team also plans to analyze agricultural water costs,                      produce a series of reports including forecasts and                      technical and policy recommendations, and engage with                      scientific and stakeholder partners through a variety of                      channels including workshops.                                          “California is fundamentally challenged by increasing                      variability in precipitation. Being able to manage this                      water for all Californians requires that we develop                      drought management tools that allow everyone to understand                      the consequences of certain actions, as well as to gain                      insight into potential remedies,” Viers said. “This                      investment by CDFA is to create the digital infrastructure                      needed for better decision making in a water-scarce                      world.”                    ",

Over the past few decades, technology has rapidly advanced with new mind-blowing                                    innovations that reshape the way we live our lives. From cell phones to computers,                                    the very internet we collaborate through are all thanks to the advances we have                                    made. They changed the way we connect with others and understand our world, however,                                    they aren’t the only ones. Another advancement that had changed our world                                    dramatically has been right under our noses since the beginning.                                                                    With funding and collaboration through LACA, Kenney and Anne Visser have been                                    researching in advancements in digital platforms and mechanization made to modern                                    agriculture. We have been able to create systems that are automated to build cars                                    and other machines but sometimes that may translate strangely to agriculture. For                                    example, strawberries and automation have had a troubled relationship, where                                    backbreaking labor would most benefit from a technological intervention. Due to the                                    complexities of strawberries, their ripeness timing, and other factors trying to                                    automate them tends to be a problem. Currently, most strawberry farmers are looking                                    more into genetically modification to make strawberries easier for machines to                                    recognize as being ripe or to ripen regularly.                                                                    Visser also discussed combine harvesters used for grains. Many in the Ag-Tech field                                    would like to increase digitization and make combine harvesters more automated. This                                    way collecting grains will not be as much of an effort for farmers and create jobs                                    that focus on caring for these systems. These are just some of the ways those within                                    the Ag-Tech field want to try to change the way we go about agriculture and create                                    more satisfying jobs for workers.                                                                    Ag-Tech is changing the way we farm. Ag-Tech has enabled the rapid development of                                    agriculture with combine harvesters to increase harvesting and irrigation that                                    enables watering in a grand scale. By continuing to advance technology for                                    agriculture we can create a sustainable environment for people to thrive and more                                    sustained job opportunities that are more rewarding and safer for farm laborers. The                                    use of Ag-Tech is beneficial not only for the environment but also the people around                                    them. With Ag-Tech you can not only improve crop production but also limit the                                    amount of chemicals and water to only what’s necessary making it safe for the farmer                                    and workers. With a focus shifting away from intensive labor the need to assist                                    these systems will go to current farmers who would still need to check and take care                                    not for every individual plant but for the machines that look after them. This means                                    that more job opportunities will be made for farmers and diverse job avenues for                                    them benefitting not only them but their communities as well. Unfortunately, there                                    has been controversy around these advancements.                                                                    There are topics regarding further development of agriculture that need to be                                    discussed as stated by Visser, “there are important consequences as it relates to                                    questions of equity and socioeconomic inequalities, and the way in which the                                    intersection of race, class, gender environment, place of residence, et cetera, all                                    will interplay.” Ultimately, Professor Visser left this discussion to the audience                                    to decide whether or not the future of agriculture should be pursued in such a way.                                    There will always be consequences to our actions but do those consequences truly                                    outweigh the benefits? I personally disagree, I think the further development of                                    agriculture can do more good than harm.                                                                    From my perspective, as a student at UC Merced, given the turbulence of COVID-19                                    pandemic protecting crops and farmer lives are vital for communities and society. We                                    should be protecting those who tend to the food we eat and help protect those whose                                    lives are at risk. With the growth of Ag-Tech and the help of LACA we can make that                                    future possible. We can change the way we do agriculture to benefit society as a                                    whole and save others when a new outbreak or challenge comes our way.

The data provided by the Landsat satellites are essential for informed land use                                    decisions and observations on climate change. Currently, the data provided displays                                    information about Earth’s vegetation, land use, coastlines and surface water, and                                    much more. Over the past half century of collected data depicts the history of how                                    the planet has changed and natural disturbances such as fires, hurricanes, and even                                    insect outbreaks that have occurred. Over time, researchers working with Landsat                                    data are able to extend the ability to measure changes on the global land surface at                                    a scale where we can even separate human and natural causes of change.

Like many American women at the time, she was met with societal barriers                                    throughout her life: being told to apply her strengths as a librarian by her high                                    school guidance counselor. graduated Salutatorian from her high school Norwood                                    attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1944. After graduation, Norwood                                    found it very difficult getting hired as a woman, as she would often be met with                                    incredulity of her abilities over a man, and asked to make promises to not get                                    pregnant if hired. In 1948, she found an opportunity to work at Evans Signal Lab, where she designed and                                    patented the first device to accurately calculate wind velocity above 100,000 ft,                                    making long-term weather prediction possible for the first time. She would later go                                    on to design and patent a novel and long classified tracking antenna using                                    polarization in the early 1950s. Norwood continued her work in the field of microwave antennas, creating IFF antennas                                    at the MIT Rad Lab. At Hughes Aircraft, where she rose to leadership positions,                                    Norwood designed communications equipment for the Surveyor, so it could receive                                    commands and send images and data back to Earth. After the Surveyor project, Norwood took a step back from weaponry and space                                    exploration to pursue a new project--a satellite that would observe Earth and                                    monitor its resources. Led by NASA and the USGS, Norwood scrapped initial plans for                                    an RBV camera, proposing to utilize a Multispectral Scanner (MSS) instead. Hughes                                    Aircraft supported the scanner with funding and Norwood overcame sceptics through                                    high quality images of famous places: her test of the MSS at Yosemite Valley and San                                    Francisco led to a both-and approach. NASA resolved the conflict by utilizing both                                    the RBV and MSS on launch of Landsat 1 on July 23, 1972. The RBV camera nearly                                    caused mission-ending complications, while Norwood’s MSS held up and continued                                    sending high quality data. Norwood would continue to work on the next four versions                                    of Landsat, all with versions of her MSS.

CITRIS at UC Merced hosted a “Ready for Blast Off” watch event with undergraduates,                                    graduate students, and staff celebrating the launch. With masks on and donuts and                                    coffees in hand, the satellite afficionados sat in anticipation as the timer counted                                    down. The group discussed topics regarding SpaceX’s Starlink satellites and                                    renewable energy aviation. Live on site, Dr. Erin Hestir shared the experience and                                    energy from Vandenburg Air Force Base via zoom.When the time for launch arrived, the group counted down with the broadcast from NASA                                    tv, “10, 9, 8, …, 3, 2, 1.” The group watched as the Atlas V rocket took off and                                    listened in on rumbling from Dr. Hestir’s end. They remarked and were awed by the                                    speed of the rocket, how quickly it reached an altitude of 437 miles above Earth’s                                    surface, and the beautiful feed of the boosters detaching from the main body and                                    falling back to Earth. Earth Observation at UC MercedDr. Erin Hestir’s Earth Observation and Remote Sensing lab (EORS) has a wide variety                                    of projects that utilize Landsat imagery to investigate the impacts of climate                                    change on Earth’s ecosystems. The EORS lab group’s research has a particular focus                                    on aquatic ecosystem, ranging from arctic to tidal wetlands, estuaries, lakes, and                                    rivers. Tasos Tentoglou, a senior in Environmental Engineering, and Brittany Lopez Barreto, a                                    4th year PhD student in Environmental Systems, have both used Landsat to investigate                                    the impacts of wildfires on California terrestrial and aquatic environments. Over                                    the past few decades, the Western U.S. has seen a record number of wildfires. These                                    large wildfires, intensified by climate change, leave significant impacts upon many                                    ecosystems. Tasos has used Landsat 8 to understand the Mendocino Complex Fire burn                                    scar to formulate insights of wildfire impacts on land albedo and albedo recovery.                                    Monitoring and understanding water quality responses to watershed dynamics and                                    wildfire is an important source of information for water managers that is necessary                                    to develop and prioritize mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring water quality and                                    water supply. Brittany has used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 to investigate post-wildfire                                    effects on water quality by deriving multi-decadal water quality trends in                                    California lakes and supply reservoirs in conjunction with occurrence, frequency,                                    and intensity of wildfires in adjoining watersheds. Brittany created a time series                                    of water quality trends for variables, such as turbidity since 1984. EORS Assistant Research Specialist, Julia Burmistrova, has been using Landsat to                                    examine the effects of lithium salt mining on deserts. The increased consumer demand                                    for lithium-ion batteries is leading to increased lithium mining globally. For                                    mining operations, a previously bare desert is converted to shallow salt evaporation                                    ponds, which changes the reflectivity of the desert. Landsat provides consistent                                    measurements of reflected and emitted energy at the spatial resolution necessary to                                    quantify seasonal albedo changes due to lithium mining. For this project, Julia and                                    collaborators used Landsat time-series data to monitor the expansion of lithium salt                                    ponds over time and long-term changes in desert surface albedo.Postdoctoral scholar Dr. Dulcinea Avouris is currently using Landsat 8 data to create                                    turbidity and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) products for the San Francisco                                    Delta. These water quality parameters are then used to investigate spatio-temporal                                    (that is, location and time) variability in the Delta. In addition, the turbidity &                                    CDOM retrievals are used as optical proxies for modeling the distribution of mercury                                    and methylmercury throughout the Delta. Methylmercury bioaccumulates in fish and                                    could be harmful to humans if they eat the fish or drink the water. The high spatial                                    resolution of Landsat is key to visualizing and assessing optical parameters in                                    smaller water bodies.

SWIM is                                    designed to provide objective measures of supply and demand, and incorporate drought                                    forecasting and climate change trends.The research and extension team, by working with local decision-makers, will improve                                    the accuracy of measurement in water budgets, evaluate novel management strategies                                    such as on-farm aquifer recharge, and evaluate water trading and markets to improve                                    sustainable surface and groundwater use.The SWIM project will work across disciplines and stakeholders, integrating research,                                    extension and education in three testbeds with unique water policies and systems:                                    Cache Valley, Utah; Mesilla Valley, New Mexico; and the San Joaquin Valley. All of                                    them grow orchard crops and alfalfa, and all are in a drought. Like California, Utah                                    is experiencing an unprecedented drought, where 99 percent of the state is in                                    extreme or exceptional drought.

The internship was led by Professor Colleen                                        Naughton and included visits to local farms and industries, giving students                                    exposure to real-world applications of the region’s agricultural industry.“The program went very well despite the continued challenges of the COVID-19                                    pandemic,” Naughton said. “It was great to be back in person for the first time                                    since Spring 2020. I learned a ton alongside the students. The students exceeded my                                    expectations for their research and poster presentations at the symposium. They put                                    in a ton of hard work and woke up early many Fridays and braved the heat to                                    participate in the practical field days.”Each student had the opportunity to select which professor and areas of focus —                                    ranging from hydrology to nutrition and food security — to work with to begin their                                    academic careers. For instance, incoming mechanical engineering student Kyle Chun                                    worked on drones with faculty mentor Professor YangQuan                                        Chen while second-year sociology student Briana Lopez studied how almonds                                    impact quality of sleep compared to other foods with Professor Rudy Ortiz.

The doctoral student is leading cutting-edge                                    remote sensing research,                                    applying satellite technology to wildfire and water quality issues. Using satellites                                    and writing programs to                                    interpret data to reveal hidden problems in water resources is one of the                                    specialties of the                                    Earth Observation and Remote                                        Sensing Lab at                                                                            University of California,                                        Merced led by Dr. Erin Hestir, Associate Director of CITRIS, UC Merced.                                Lopez Barreto has been named a NASA Future Investigator in Earth Space Science                                        and Technology, also                                    known as the NASA FINESST Program. Her proposal on wildfire and water supply was                                    selected from 835                                    highly competitive proposals, 351 of which were in Earth Science. The program                                    provides 3-year                                    research grants to graduate students who design and perform projects relevant to                                    NASA's Science                                    Mission Directorate. Given California’s approaching wildfire season and the well-documented increase                                    in intensity, size and frequency of fires, Lopez Barreto’s work is extremely                                    timely. The fires leave soils bare and disturbed making them susceptible to                                    erosion. The sediments make their way through hillsides and streams to                                    reservoirs. The proposal titled ""Wildfire Effects on Water Quality in California                                    Water Supply Reservoirs"" will use satellite data to calculate the levels of                                    sediment and blue-green algae in water and examine the traits of different                                    wildfires across the state over the past 30 years to provide in-depth watershed                                    analysis for water managers across the state. A major portion of Western water supply comes from lands where wildfires are a                                    frequent and growing concern, but the effects of the wildfire activities in                                    these watersheds, and risks posed to public water supplies are little                                    understood. As wildfires in the Western U.S. are a commonplace event,                                    quantifying and predicting the effects of fire on water resources is critical                                    for meeting our current and future water needs. “This cascade of potential consequences make it dire to understand the                                    relationship wildfire has on water quality in order to prepare for the future                                    under climate change. California’s unique climate and ecosystems afford new                                    insights on wildfire’s role on water quality in a landscape that has been facing                                    an increasing amount of wildfire,” said Lopez Barreto.As an advisor, Hestir has seen tremendous growth all areas that lead to a strong                                    professor,                                    from research to teaching to mentorship. Hestir said, “We in California are lucky to                                    have                                    talented young researchers turning their attention to our water and wildfire issues                                    as¬ the                                    two are inextricably linked. Brittany’s focus on wildfire effects on water quality                                    is critical,                                    but until now understudied aspect of water security and wildfire risk for our                                    communities.                                    We in Merced are doubly lucky to have Brittany’s skill and passion for teaching and                                    mentoring.”Lopez Barreto started her environmental career pursuing a Bachelors of Science at                                    UC Davis in Environmental Science and Management and upon completion, directly                                    joined UC Merced’s transdisciplinary Environmental Systems program. She also is                                    a teaching assistant for engineering courses on Remote sensing of the                                    Environment and Spatial Analysis and Modeling.

As a first-generation Latina, she recognizes how rare she is in STEM. “I believe                                    it is important to be present and to share experiences in STEM to show that STEM                                    is possible for anyone who is interested,” said Lopez Barreto. “I thoroughly                                    enjoyed speaking to them on a more intimate level because ultimately one’s                                    educational and career path is not entirely black and white, especially coming                                    from a disadvantaged background.”“Professors are in a special position to be able to grow the next generation of                                    future environmental leaders. A professor’s work does not stop at just academia                                    and research, but also extends to outreach and service. And that’s part of what                                    intrigues me about this higher education career path,” said Lopez Barreto. The                                    work will be shared with water managers across the state. ",

The two talked water management approaches, from Sustainable Groundwater                                        Management Act’s limitations on groundwater use to planting orchards with denser                                        trees to increase shade and decrease water. They also spoke about energy                                        production and agriculture, such as the use of agrovoltaics, where solar panels                                        in the fields of crops, and reducing water loss by covering canals with solar                                        panels. “Instead of looking for a silver bullet, we need some silver buckshot,                                        which is to say we’ve got to do a lot of little things right, and taken                                        together, we may just solve some of these problems,” said Viers.                                    There’s no such thing as a normal water year                                        With esteemed colleague and faculty at Utah State University, Sarah Null, Viers                                        had conducted a study that explains California’s annual precipitation is                                        changing at a pace that makes it harder to plan.                                                                            “Just looking at an average really doesn't get at the heart of our challenges as                                        that suggests that there's some normality in our water years, and we know that                                        that's far from the truth,” said Viers. “In fact, the Department of Water                                        Resources doesn't even have a normal water year by definition.”                                                                            “We already have reservoirs built about everywhere that you can imagine,”                                        remarked Willey.                                                                            “What we projected ten years ago as coming to bear is more of a bi-modal                                        distribution.” Viers elaborated, “Things are getting pushed to the extreme. The                                        analysis showed that for the dry and critically dry years, we expect to increase                                        three-fold for the San Joaquin.”                                    UC Merced Experimental Smart FarmProf. Viers (right) leads a group of UCM faculty and staff along the canal                                            near the proposed site of the UCM Experimental Smart Farm                                        To harness the power of the faculty and students of UC Merced, the campus                                        intends to invest in a 40-acre farm at the edge of campus. “To be considered a                                        national leader in sustainability and how that affects food, food production,                                        and what we refer to as the food energy water nexus ... our Chancellor has now                                        committed to building a 40 acre experimental smart farm.”                                                                            “Our intent is to bring not just research, but to bring our students out there                                        and to bring the community out there so that it can be a demonstration space for                                        how technology may improve sustainability.”                                                                            Viers introduced the components of the smart farm and new funding from the                                        University of California Office of the President for Labor and Automation in                                        California Agriculture: robotics and autonomous vehicles are one part, “but we                                        also bring in humanists and labor advocates and people in Extension that really                                        know how humans can and will remain in the loop for food production,” Viers                                        said. “It addresses issues of upskilling the agricultural workforce.”                                    Faculty and staff stand in front of the wetland in the proposed Experimental                                            Smart Farm.                                        Willey ushered concerns: “Agriculture has been pretty exploitative of farmers                                        and farm laborers for about 10,000 years. And whether we can turn the tables on                                        that or not is a very serious and necessary issue. But since we haven't                                        accomplished that in 10,000 years, it's a big ask to say that we're going to                                        change that equation.”                                    Finally, they discussed the future of the San Joaquin Valley. “Assume that we’re                                        going to have a civilization here a hundred years from now, what’s it going to                                        look like?” asked Willey.                                         “I think everyone has a role in helping that come to fruition and really trying                                        to identify the vision for how we want to live here.”                                                                            Viers continued, “Humans have certainly persisted on this planet for quite a                                        while now. And there's always been some ingenuity and some adaptation. It is yet                                        to be determined how technology may play a role in this. I'd like to think that                                        if constructed well and used appropriately, it can certainly be a part of that                                        equation, but at the end of the day, we're all human, and we need to keep humans                                        in the loop.”                                                                            “Yes, indeed. We're very adaptable species,” said Willey. “And the more                                        cooperative we become, probably will give us the greater chances of survival                                        into the future.”                                                                            Listen online                                        or download from the Down on the Farm with Tom Willey and subscribe to receive                                        the podcast each month.

From deserts                                    to shrubland to montane forests, the diversity of life in South Africa’s Greater                                    Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) is the subject of NASA’s first biodiversity campaign                                    led by University of California, Merced Professor Erin Hestir.The program is a collaboration with Professor Adam Wilson at State University of                                        New                                        York at Buffalo and local partners in South Africa like the South African Ecological                                            Observation Network and the South African Space Agency.Hestir describes why the “Cape” is such an important place for biodiversity                                        studies.                                    “The Cape contains two global biodiversity hotspots, meaning there’s                                        a lot of                                        different species in one area.

After spending a year working and studying remotely, many                    people are ready to get out from behind their computer                    screens and spend some time in nature.                                      Those interested in exploring the great outdoors can venture                    to the lesser-known Sequoia & Kings Canyon National                    Park, about one hour east of Fresno. Many go for the famous                    wildflower bloom, but if you’re not sure where to start,                    grab                    Leigh Bernacchi’s                    recently published guide “Sequoia & Kings Canyon                    National Park: Hiking, Camping, Waterfalls & Big Trees”                    (Moon, 2021) and hit the road and trail.                    Bernacchi is the program director of UC Merced’s Center for                    Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society                    (CITRIS) and a staff researcher for the Sierra Nevada Research                    Institute (SNRI). A native of the Sierra Nevada foothills, Bernacchi                    worked as a naturalist ranger in Sequoia, Denali and                    Yosemite national parks before joining the campus in 2015.                    She is interested in the intersection of public                    participation, natural resources and wildlife — all of which                    have informed her scientific pursuits and this travel guide.                                      “This book is a love letter to our Valley community members,                    to get out and experience the astounding beauty, in every                    season, of these wild parks,” Bernacchi said. “Whether                    hiking solo or with friends, with my grandma or my kid, I                    researched this book over several years to create each                    itinerary and experience. There’s something for everyone,                    and it’s so close to UC Merced.”                                      Sequoia and Kings Canyon boasts the highest peak in the                    lower 48 states — Mount Whitney — and the Giant Sequoias,                    including General Sherman, the largest living being in the                    world.

It tested the thesis that by erecting a modular system of solar shading                                    panels over California’s exposed aqueducts, the state can reduce evaporative water                                    loss and provide a variety of benefits when compared to conventional ground-mounted                                    solar systems. The Solar AquaGrid study was underwritten by NRG Energy, with                                    development support from the Bay Area agency Citizen Group.Results show a savings of 63 billion gallons of water annually, which is comparable                                    to the amount needed to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or meet the residential                                    water needs of more than 2 million people. And the 13 gigawatts of solar power the                                    solar panels would generate each year would equal about one sixth of the state’s                                    current installed capacity — roughly half the projected new capacity needed by 2030                                    to meet the state’s decarbonization goals.“The SolarAqua Grid model provides a combined, integrated response to addressing our                                    water/energy nexus,” Bales said. “It can help address California’s underlying                                    vulnerabilities while meeting both state and federal level commitments to produce                                    renewable energy, lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.                                    Solutions such as these are not only viable but more urgently needed than ever                                    before, particularly as the region returns to what many researchers refer to as a                                    paleo-drought — a worst-case scenario for water managers.”“We were surprised by the significant evaporation savings, which we project to be as                                    much as 82%,” added UC Santa Cruz postdoctoral scholar Brandi McKuin, lead author of                                    the report. “That amount of water can make a significant difference in water-short                                    regions.” Because the solar panels shade the canals from direct sunlight, McKuin added, they                                    would not only mitigate evaporation but also curtail the growth of aquatic weeds and                                    reduce maintenance costs, while the evaporation that does occur actually cools the                                    panels, increasing their efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity.The analysis shows that adding solar coverings above canals that run across ‘already                                    disturbed land’ means developers can avoid protracted environmental permitting and                                    right-of-way issues so systems can be deployed more quickly and cost effectively.                                The study estimates that, for California, the resulting annual savings in maintenance                                    costs could be as much as $40,000 per mile of canal. In addition, the retirement of                                    old diesel pumps and generators in favor of solar arrays would contribute to cleaner                                    air in California’s Central Valley, which suffers from among the worst air quality                                    in the nation. “What is most compelling about this study is that when you tally up the multiple                                    benefits,” Bales said, “solar over canals represents the sort of shift in thinking                                    that California and the world need as we transition our economy and infrastructure                                    to a fossil-free, sustainable future.” The UC Solar AquaGrid study comes at a time when there is growing urgency for                                    shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy. UC engineers are rethinking how                                    aging water and energy infrastructure can adapt to the challenges of sustainable                                    water management, catastrophic wildfires, multi-day power outages and the American                                    West’s ""megadrought” — an ongoing stretch of extended dry conditions worse than any                                    experienced since 1603, according to a recent report in the journal Science.The Biden administration has called for rapid modernization of water, transportation                                    and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate. Federal                                    agencies have been directed to identify new opportunities to spur innovation,                                    commercialization and deployment of clean-energy technologies and infrastructure.                                California is calling for 50% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by                                    2030 and the sale of all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035.This study demonstrates one way to further the mission of sustainability by using                                    existing structures.“Aqueducts are the arteries of our economic and social development, and have captured                                    the public’s imagination for centuries,” said former State Water Board Chair Felicia                                    Marcus. “A significant amount of our state’s electricity bill comes from moving,                                    treating and heating water, so water efficiency is also energy efficiency. We need                                    to find every way we can to use water more efficiently, including stemming                                    evaporative loss, as we also scale up clean energy to meet the needs of the                                    challenging century ahead under climate change.”",

Before joining UC Merced – the tenth and newest campus of the University of                                    California – as Founding Faculty in 2004, she was a Research Associate at Stanford                                    University and worked at IBM Research. Her groundbreaking research was at the heart                                    of human-computer interaction, where she pioneered and patented early digital input                                    devices. She has since published over 100 peer-reviewed articles spanning cognitive                                    science, psychology, linguistics and human-computer interaction. She has served on                                    several editorial boards, including Cognitive Science and Environmental                                        Communication, as well as serving on the governing board of the Cognitive                                    ScienceSociety and on the National Institute of Health’s Language and Communication                                    study section.                                                                    “Front and center, Mentoring, mentoring, mentoring.” Matlock’s remarks were filled                                    with gratitude and focused on mentorship. Mentors of her past and how we can all be                                    mentors today. She shared that academic leadership means learning “how to build a                                    good work culture, how to help others advance in their careers, and promoting                                    diversity and inclusion.”                                                                    “I’m grateful to all the mentors I’ve had along the way,” Matlock said, starting                                    with her first academic passion: playing trumpet. “Alberto Rodriguez would say,                                    ‘Stop complaining, stop making excuses, and get to work.”                                                                    “My next mentor knew how to model good behavior that others would learn. She taught                                    me how to give a good talk, be confident, and find a good research question.”                                                                    Finally, “many years later, J. Arthur Woodward, had been at UC over 25 years!                                    There’s even a mentoring award named after him. He would ask, ‘What are you doing                                    right now and why is it important to your own research and UC Merced?” Matlock                                    attributes to the late Prof. Woodward her skill and dedication in creating new                                    opportunities for others.                                                                    At UC Merced, “We’re seeing the benefits of mentoring. And we have lots to be proud                                    of even though we’re young.”                                                                    She recommended, “Get mentoring and be a mentor. And when you’re a mentor to others,                                    look for diverse opportunities to mentor high school students and people early                                    career.

She has served as Vice Chair of                                    the American Indian Council of Mariposa and continues to engage in community                                    activities with local Native American tribal groups, including her own, Southern                                    Sierra Miwuk, to promote better educational opportunities and create bridges between                                    the University of California and local indigenous peoples. Several years ago, she                                    served on the systemwide President’s Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture and                                    Inclusion. In addition to her scholarly and leadership activities, Matlock is a                                    trumpet player, who performs with local jazz musicians.                                ",

As time progresses and                                        society and cities change, we need to adapt infrastructure to change as well.                                                                            One of the main points that Professor Markolf makes is about the Anthropocene.                                        He discusses it as the “age of humans” and how humanity has caused exponential                                        changes in many of the systems around us. However, we are not prepared to battle                                        against or adapt to the rapid changes. Our infrastructure is one of the victims                                        of these changes. With a rapidly changing environment due to climate change and                                        greenhouse gases, some buildings and infrastructure cannot adapt to the changes                                        and face damage which place lives at risk.                                                                            A recent example are the buildings in Texas. Infrastructure in the arid                                        southwest is built to survive heatwaves and hot summers—not snowstorms. When the                                        2021 winter storm stretched across Texas their buildings                                        were not able to handle                                        it. This caused homes to become dangerously cold and energy systems failed. This                                        is not the fault of the creators of a lot of Texas infrastructure as the current                                        method of preparing a building for an area is based on frequency-based design.                                        This is where the frequency of a disaster happening such as heatwaves are taken                                        into consideration, and thus, the infrastructure is built to adapt to that                                        specific risk. According to Markolf, the approach, though, focuses on risk more                                        implicitly, rather than explicitly.                                                                            As the last CITIRS Research Exchange of the spring semester, Professor Markolf’s                                        presentation was deeply informative and fascinating to watch.

SWEEP, as the program is commonly known, added an Ad                      Hoc advisory group in response to stakeholders request.                      The group is responsible for creating recommendations to                      help farmers and water managers improve efficiency and                      improve participation across the state.                                          Prof. Josué Medellín-Azuara and Prof. Sarah                      Kurtz, both CITRIS-affiliated researchers and UC Merced                      School of Engineering faculty, will contribute their water                      and energy expertise to the agriculture-focused advisory                      board.                                          While the main goal is water efficiency, SWEEP funds and                      supports projects that reduce costs for farmers and                      ranchers while achieving environmental benefits, like                      reducing greenhouse gas emissions or energy for water                      pumping.                                          This is one of the many reasons why Josué                      Medellín-Azuara, Associate Professor of Civil and                      Environmental Engineering, joined SWEEP in fall of 2020.                      “The program considers water balance approach                      without encouraging acreage expansions. Yet, what I like                      the most about the SWEEP program is that                      irrigation efficiency encompasses not just water                      but also cleaner energy.”                                          Medellín-Azuara’s research on economic impacts of recent                      California droughts has served CDFA in the past. “I                      always thought SWEEP was an ambitious and worthwhile                      endeavor.”                                          The lead of the Water Systems Management Lab at UC Merced,                      Medellín-Azuara said, “Water efficiency in                      agriculture is complex. Sometimes reductions in applied                      water might have unintended consequences for aquifer                      recharge. Or water savings might lead to more areas being                      irrigated.”                                          “Combining improvements in irrigation efficiency and                      reductions in GHG emissions is a step forward. What really                      motivated me to join was  the opportunity to include                      equity elements into the program which provide smaller                      farm operations and farmers in underserved communities,                      with a fair amount of technical assistance for filling out                      applications.”                                          Professor of Materials Sciences                      Sarah Kurtz’s expertise lies more in renewable energy than                      water, but she is equally devoted to equity and multiple                      uses for agricultural lands. In 2019, when she joined the                      faculty of UC Merced, Prof. Kurtz hosted a biogas and                      agriculture workshop with CITRIS. And since many of                      SWEEP’s programs include solar energy, Kurtz’s                      leadership in the field and vision for equitable access to                      economical energy will help guide CDFA programming.                                          Prof. Kurtz said “SWEEP is an excellent program that                      funds farmers to use irrigation that saves water and                      reduces greenhouse gases. It’s a real privilege for                      me to participate on the Ad Hoc Sub-Advisory Group.”                                          Medellín-Azuara added that being part of SWEEP is                      important for our community. “Given UC                      Merced’s growing ties with our surrounding                      agricultural community, I felt SWEEP, in addition to my                      lab’s research, was a good place for me to                      participate with CDFA.”                    ",

The reason is to adapt to the changes in California farm workforce and land                                        availability. Traditional farming requires backbreaking intense labor, secure                                        water resources, and extensive inputs like fertilizer to maintain crops.                                        However, LACA hopes to solve most of these issues with the implementation of                                        more sophisticated technology which will help manage farms sustainably. Sensors                                        will be used to ensure the proper use of water. Robots will be used to help                                        maintain plant health and communicate to farmers of any issues via a server. The                                        technology will be given to farms of all sizes, big or small. Currently they're                                        in                                        the works of trying to help smaller farms be able to afford this technology                                        through various means like Co-Op to ensure they can reduce the amount of stress                                        on the employees. This technology will not only help the farmer’s, but                                        it will also create new jobs for students researching in STEM and provide jobs                                        close to them.                                                                            It is interesting how far technology has become where projects like this seem                                        close to fruition. With this new way of agriculture, we hope to see a growth in                                        the Central Valley creating a more sustainable, safe, and hopeful future for                                        many low-income families. As a UC Merced student, in the heart of America’s most                                        productive agricultural lands, I am excited to see the Central Valley will grow                                        thanks to LACA and the future of ag-tech holds.                                                                            The team is working together to make this future possible, including amazing                                        talent here from CITRIS at UC Merced. Leading with Harmon is Erin Hestir,                                        Associate Professor in Civil & Environmental Engineering, and Colleen Naughton,                                        Assistant Professor in Civil & Environmental Engineering.

The 2021 EFF program began in January with grant writing                      training and will continue throughout the spring semester.                      Fellows will also have the opportunity to visit                      congressional and agency leaders in Washington, D.C.                                          One of the selected fellows is                      Spencer Castro, a new faculty member in Management of Complex Systems                      who is building on a family legacy. His grandfather                      self-produced safety videos for arborists and started the                      Yosemite National Park prescribed burning program. Both                      his parents fought wildland fires, and growing up in                      Yosemite gave Castro first-hand experience with challenges                      faced by local communities.                                          “As someone who has evacuated many times and has multiple                      family members scattered throughout the foothills, I would                      personally like to help find solutions to these problems,”                      said Castro. He wants to improve how we educate                      communities about wildfires. “Like other natural                      disasters, the intermittence of fire leads to apathy when                      easily accessible training and proper preparation could                      save lives, especially in nearby communities.”                                          His work is precisely geared at enabling smart                      decision-making to prepare Californians for the next big                      fire. “The EFF training will provide me with the skills to                      create a sustainable research program and increase                      confidence when interacting with large government                      agencies,” Castro said. The practical nature of his work                      is also supported by cognitive science, and a long-range                      goal of his is to develop a human-computer interaction lab                      that tests the cognitive workload during disasters. “I                      want to improve the safety of everyday technologies, and                      especially those used in emergencies.”                                          EFF Fellow and Professor of Life and Environmental                      Sciences                      Rebecca Ryals                      is famous for getting her hands dirty, turning all matter                      of waste—including human waste—into fertilizer for                      agriculture. And her work doesn’t stop there. Storing                      waste in a useable format reduces greenhouse gases and                      more. “Healthy soils feed us. Climate change is a wicked                      problem but there are many solutions. The way we steward                      soils and their incredible capacity to store carbon can                      help solve our climate crisis. More carbon in the soil                      improves our ability to grow food, reduces nutrient                      pollution, and more efficiently use water,” said Ryals.                                          Her work contributes to a growing body of literature                      around the idea that agriculture is both the contributor                      and the solution to climate change. By composting                      everything from manure to human waste, Ryals is closing                      the loop through agroecology. Ryals recently discussed her                      work during a                      Down on the Farm podcast                      interview.                                          When asked about the EFF program Ryals said, “I am excited                      about this training. For me, it is an opportunity to not                      only hone my grant writing skills, but also to learn how                      to more successfully navigate the complex funding                      ecosystem.”                                           Castro and Ryals recognize the importance of growing as                      successful faculty and community members. “As scientists,                      we have the incredible privilege to explore the world by                      asking questions, collecting data, and building onto the                      wealth of knowledge in the world,” said Ryals.                      “I want to use that privilege to do impactful,                      solutions-based research.”                    ",

She is known for early contributions to the field of                                    human-computer interaction. For instance, she was issued a U.S. patent for rapid                                    symbolic input in small, handheld devices as a result of her work at IBM Research in                                    the late 1990s and early 2000s. She also did seminal work on how people think about                                    and describe emerging technological developments, such as search engines when the                                    Web was popularized.“This award — appropriately named for a female deity of wisdom — is well deserved,”                                    Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz said. “Professor Matlock’s contributions to her                                    academic field, issues of diversity and inclusion, to the growth of human knowledge                                    and to UC Merced have been invaluable.

Furthermore, her local connections underscore the                                    importance of building and maintaining a vibrant community beyond our campus.”At UC Merced, Matlock has broken down academic hierarchies and spearheaded an effort                                    to                                    hire new faculty using innovative approaches to inclusivity, and initiated the                                    institutional membership to the National Center for Faculty Development and                                    Diversity.

She has published over 100 peer-reviewed                                        articles and has been awarded over $2M in extramural research funding. Matlock                                        pioneered human-computer interaction research in the early 2000s, well before                                        the ubiquity of attentive systems, and continues to push the boundaries of                                        language processing through a deeper understanding of human communication. She                                        is notably transdisciplinary in her approaches, meshing research across                                        cognitive linguistics, experimental psychology, and human-computer interaction.                                        At UC Merced, Matlock has broken down academic hierarchies and spearheaded an                                        effort to hire new faculty using innovative approaches to inclusivity, and                                        initiated the institutional membership to the National Center for Faculty                                        Development and Diversity. Her commitment to guide women to succeed in                                        technology is reflected through the expanded career opportunities she has opened                                        for her mentees.

From precision                      applications to yield monitors, massive amounts of data                      are collected on farms. With Martin Kenney and Anne Visser                      from UC Davis and John Zysman from UC Berkeley, the team                      will review digital platforms for agricultural data by                      interviewing the developers and users and reviewing the                      literature.                                          A second award focuses on a key barrier to independent                      living for older adults: the risk of falling. Medical                      treatments for falls are painful, costly and lead to                      potentially more challenges for the patient and their                      families. 25% of older adults fall every year, and 20% of                      these falls result in serious injuries, but new technology                      research can catch some falls before they happen.                                          Two of the newest UC Merced faculty in computer science                      are teaming up with Healthy Aging Association’s Young-At-Heart balance training classes, including on zoom, to                      help prevent falls. Computer Science professors Wan Du and Shijia Pan are relying on the testbed of the workout and                      balance training classes to improve the lives of                      participants and older adults everywhere. Pan’s lab                      explores new ways to achieve accurate monitoring without                      hampering privacy and movements by making Internet of                      Things (IoT) sensing systems smarter. “Smart home                      applications enhance people’s quality of life”                      Pan said.                                           The data collected will provide personalized                      recommendations based on how high the older adult lifts                      their foot, the length of their step, the rhythm of their                      gait, strength, and other metrics. Using fine-scale                      information from wristbands and floor tiles instrumented                      with sensors they will interpret normal walking, and                      pre-fall walking. They plan to expand this work in                      non-controlled environments, using similar comfortable                      sensors. Complex math and communication among all sensors                      underlie the interpretations of data in near-real time,                      eventually alerting caretakers to increased risk of falls.                      With JoAnn Seibles of the Department of Family and                      Community Medicine at UC Davis, the team is using an                      interdisciplinary approach, bringing together computer                      science, social epidemiology and quantitative psychology.                      Pan also won best paper for her work at prestigious                      conferences, including work on the footstep-induced floor                      vibrations.                                          Finally, Networking is not just awkward introductions; it                      is a critical key to accessing careers and opportunities                      through near-peers. CITRIS awarded another proposal to                      improve student access to networks through a series of                      mentoring events and direct connections across Berkeley,                      Davis and Merced graduate and undergraduate students in                      Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics—the                      STEM fields.

Hestir reflected the personal                      motivation of the work: “I would not be where I am                      today if not for the mentors in my life. I want to afford                      our students the same opportunities.”                    A UC Merced student’s walk yields vibrations on                        the floor sensors (Photo: Shijia Pan)",

The multicampus                                        institutes share a vital mission: to improve the lives of Californians by                                        tackling large-scale societal problems through interdisciplinary research and                                        new market applications. Since its founding, CITRIS has been headquartered at UC Berkeley with partner                                        campuses at Davis (including Davis Health), Merced, and Santa Cruz. Together                                        faculty, postdocs, students, clinicians, and research staff have been working to                                        anticipate and meet society’s technological needs. In 2016, the Banatao                                        Institute was added to CITRIS’s name across all four campuses, in recognition of                                        foundational donors Dado and Maria Banatao.“From its founding, CITRIS’s mission has been to develop and apply information                                        technology to create innovative solutions to some of today’s greatest                                        challenges, be they natural, economic, or societal,” said Randy Katz, Vice Chancellor for Research and first                                        Interim Director of CITRIS at UC Berkeley. “The Institute has a justifiably                                        proud two-decade-long track record of high impact research, and I look forward                                        to its innovations for many years to come.”Innovation Ecosystem at CITRISTo create a vital hub for information technology research and to participate in                                        the Silicon Valley entrepreneurial ecosystem, CITRIS facilitates cross-campus                                        collaboration through its CITRIS Seed Funding program, supports UC                                        startups through the CITRIS Foundry, and develops industry partnerships with                                        Siemens, Komatsu, Microsoft, Lam Research and more. Sutardja Dai Hall on the UC Berkeley campus was built to house CITRIS and opened                                        in 2009. Sutardja Dai Hall offers researchers access to world-class facilities,                                        including the Berkeley Marvell Nanofabrication Laboratory at                                            CITRIS, which also opened in 2009. The NanoLab offers 15,000 square feet                                        of Class 100/1000 cleanroom for use by more than 600 researchers, along with                                        industry leaders such as Hewlett Packard, Applied Materials, and Intel. For more                                        than a decade, NanoLab researchers have pioneered new technologies including                                        testing wireless sensors known as Smart Dust; demonstrating that                                        silicon microrobots can walk,                                            jump, and fly; and inventing optoelectronic tweezers, a development that                                        led to the formation of Berkeley Lights.                                     The CITRIS Invention Lab was the                                        first makerspace on the Berkeley campus when it opened in 2012. The Invention                                        Lab has been home to creators who experiment with 3D printing and rapid                                        prototyping to build low-cost, customizable prosthetics, such as Sophie’s Hand, and researchers who are                                        harnessing novel tech to combat Alzheimer’s disease with                                            light. The CITRIS Foundry, launched in 2013, has helped University of California                                        startups develop products using technologies like gene editing, artificial                                        intelligence, and sensor networks. This ecosystem has supported 100 companies,                                        including Storx Technologies to monitor                                            fetal health, the nanomaterials company Correlia                                            Biosystems, and many more. Through a competitive seed funding program, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute have                                        catalyzed promising new technology projects. Since 2008, CITRIS Seed Funding has advanced 222 projects                                        led by more than 460 researchers from all CITRIS campuses, resulting in                                        extramural funding up to four times the initial support via public, private, and                                        philanthropic sources.Fostering the Future of Information TechnologyIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, CITRIS pivoted to launch three new health                                        intervention programs in 2020. Moving swiftly to deploy funding, the CITRIS COVID-19 Response Seed                                            Funding Program kicked off in May 2020, funding 31 projects focused on                                        clinical care, contact tracing, testing, personal protective equipment, and                                        more. All 31 projects launched and were reporting progress within three weeks of                                        receiving awards. Additionally, the C3.ai Digital Transformation                                            Institute at CITRIS pivoted its awards to fund scientists working to mitigate the spread of                                            COVID-19. The CITRIS Health program has developed two telehealth initiatives this year: Lighthouse for Older Adults                                        and ACTIVATE. Lighthouse will                                        develop a national model for telehealth through digital literacy training and                                        infrastructure support, while ACTIVATE is piloting a rural telehealth solution                                        focused on at-risk populations in California’s Central Valley. Along with this pandemic-focused health programming, CITRIS continues advancing                                        faculty and student research and entrepreneurship through several other                                        initiatives. Other CITRIS programming and research efforts include expanding Aviation and UAV Facilities, which help ensure                                        regulatory compliance for unmanned aerial systems and facilitates a Drone                                        Training Academy for high school students; Tech for Social Good, a student discovery program that                                        empowers students to develop hardware, software, events, or public programs; and                                        the Women in Tech Initiative, which supports data-driven                                        diversity research and engages corporate partners to help create a more                                        equitable and inclusive workforce. Launched in 2018, the CITRIS Policy Lab supports interdisciplinary research in key areas, including health, inclusive AI,                                        and environmental sustainability. Last year, Spanos and the CITRIS Policy Lab                                        team traveled to the U.S. capitol to help inform AI regulation                                            and policy.“COVID-19 has demonstrated the importance of our research community’s work and                                        ability to respond quickly,” said Camille Crittenden, Executive Director of CITRIS and the                                        Banatao Institute. “This year has sped up so many technological advances from                                        the increased use of robotics to completely remote workforces.

It’s a national issue: Science, technology, engineering and                                        mathematics — the STEM fields —comprise proportions of women and                                        people of color far lower than the population at large. At UC Merced, women make                                        up 51 percent of the student body, but 40 percent of STEM students, and of that,                                        only 20 percent are School of Engineering majors.¡Valle!, now in its second                                        year, helps Central Valley students stay in STEM studies and access                                        opportunities.

The final presentation and                      panel discussion concludes on Friday, November 20, but all                      of the videos are available online on the                      AEESP YouTube Channel.                      Each week researchers and faculty present impacts of                      COVID-19 on various topics. These topics range from                      systematic bias and environmental engineering education to                      designing a future without pollution and waste. Presenters                      share short yet formal talks and discuss across the panel,                      answering audience questions. Questions can either be                      tweeted or sent in Zoom Q&A function where the meeting is                      hosted.                                          As a student at UC Merced , I have found the COVID 19                      conference incredibly interesting and an enjoyable to                      experience. I personally learned a lot while watching                      these conferences and developed a newfound respect for                      professors and researchers working through the pandemic.                                          Naughton presented on wastewater and early detections of                      spikes in COVID-19 through human waste. COVID-19 can be                      spread before any symptoms arrive making it hard to just                      track COVID-19 cases through tests, but samples taken from                      wastewater treatment sites can illustrate the                      concentration of COVID-19 in areas served by that                      treatment site. Given how little we know about the broad                      population, wastewater can be an early indicator.                                          Naughton and her lab collaborate with over 140 different                      universities across the world to help track COVID cases in                      those areas and share information through a dashboard and                      on twitter handle                      @COVIDpoops19. The work has helped communities near wastewater                      treatment sites, universities, and cities and towns as                      well. This novel detection method could be a safe means of                      testing populations.                                          Naughton, who also received CITRIS COVID19 Seed Funding                      for her work on wastewater treatment, presented in                      the CITRIS responds to COVID 19 seminar                      on Nov. 18.                    Professor Susan Masten from Michigan State                        University                      wanted to ensure her students were doing well and learning                      throughout the pandemic. She talked about the stress                      COVID-19 has exacted on students, including challenges                      with learning. To increase flexibility, she made her                      lectures prerecorded and uploaded for easy access, but                      labs were a different story. Hands-on learning in lab                      courses are normally done on campus with assistance and                      special equipment. Masten created lab curriculum based on                      inexpensive and readily available kits. Regardless of                      where the student lived, they will be able to perform the                      experiment outside of the lab and without paying a heavy                      price for expensive equipment. She put her student’s                      mental health and disposition first and adjusted her                      curriculum so they could work efficiently. As a student, I                      appreciate how this professor dedicated herself to make                      sure students can learn through these tough times.                                          The work researchers and professors have been doing not                      only their students but their community.

Naughton concluded the session she moderated with                      sentiments worth sharing here about the better world we                      all dream of and are working to create, dedicating the                      session to her grandmother.

That future is possible.                        …                        I challenge you to commit even more to make that                        alternative a reality.",
agplant,NEW PRECISION AG PROJECT WOULD HELP FARMERS MEASURE PLANT MOISTURE,https://citris.ucmerced.edu/news/agplant,2020-11-02 00:00:00,"Professor Joshua Viers and Professor Stefano Carpin are working to create a robot that can gauge the moisture level of crops in the field. Backed by an over 1 million dollar USDA grant, this robot hopes to save farmers time and money which will translate to savings in the food-production chain.","The base robot for the new plant-moisture-measuring system researchers are                                            developing will navigate rows of crops to reach individual leaves and                                            stems.One of the biggest challenges in managing crops, especially in large fields, is                                        knowing how much water each section of a field needs. Determining that                                        accurately is a cumbersome process that requires people to hand-pluck individual                                        leaves from plants, put them in pressure chambers and apply air pressure to see                                        when water begins to leak from the leaf stems.                                    That kind of testing is time consuming and means that farmers can only reach so                                        many areas of a field each day and cannot test as frequently as they should.                                    Computer                                            Science and Engineering  Chair  Professor Stefano                                            Carpin,                                             Environmental Engineering   Professor Joshua Viers                                         and professors Konstantinos Karydis and Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury at UC                                        Riverside recently received a more than $1 million grant from the U.S.                                        Department of Agriculture through the National Science Foundation’s National                                        Robotics Initiative to address these challenges.                                    They are developing a robotic pressure chamber that can harvest its own sample                                        leaves and test them on site, immediately, to provide the freshest data. The                                        system will work to gather data even in large fields, and over a period of time                                        rather than just providing a snapshot.                                    Having field data that’s updated frequently can help farmers plan irrigation                                        frequency and conserve water, optimize the time and effort spent by crop                                        specialists, and help decrease some of the costs in the food-production chain.                                    Current measuring techniques involve collecting leaf samples and transporting all                                        of them to an off-site location, where testers can use very accurate, expensive                                        pressure chambers; and sampling and analyzing leaf samples in the field using                                        hand-held pressure chambers, Karydis explained.                                    In the first category, leaf samples can get mixed up, making it impossible to                                        track them back to the specific areas of the field they came from, Karydis said.                                    “In addition, the properties of the leaf might vary given the time elapsed                                        between being sampled and being analyzed, which in turn may yield misleading                                        results,” he said.                                    Hand-held instruments in the field can be less accurate, but testing can be done                                        multiple times with different leaves from the same plants, but this method is                                        time- and labor-intensive, and must be undertaken by specially trained                                        personnel, he said.                                    “If we’re going to use precision agriculture, we need the most accurate                                        information-gathering systems we can make,” Carpin said.                                    He has already worked with colleagues at UCs Davis and Berkeley to create the                                             Robot-Assisted Precision Irrigation Delivery (RAPID)  system, which                                        travels along rows of crops adjusting irrigation flows according to sensor data                                        that tells the robot precisely what’s needed for each plant.                                    They’ll use the same base robot as RAPID, but equip it with GPS and a pressure                                        chamber being designed by the researchers at Riverside, and pair it with drones                                        that can survey the fields and direct the robot to areas of interest.                                    “Using this process, farmers could survey plants all day long, even in large                                        fields,” Carpin said.                                    The four-year project will support graduate students as well as summer research                                        opportunities for undergraduates. The project has four phases: development of                                        the chamber; developing machine-vision so the robot can “see” the water coming                                        from the leaf stems; coordinating multiple robots — in the air and on the                                        ground; and evaluation.                                    The researchers plan to have the first set of automated pressure chamber                                        prototypes fabricated by Spring 2021, and to evaluate their performance and                                        refine designs in controlled settings over Spring and Summer 2021. They expect                                        to have a completed setup by Winter 2022 so they can begin controlled field                                        testing.                                    “We have to be quick about it because if we miss a peak growing season, we have                                        to wait another nine months for the next one,” Carpin said. “We’d like to be                                        able to start testing next summer and test every summer, and we need to be able                                        to maximize the tests.”                                    When all of the components have been designed, the designs and code will be open                                        source, and all the data collected during the project will be made available to                                        the scientific community, the researchers wrote in their proposal.                                    The project came about after Carpin and Viers, director of the  Center for Information Technology                                            Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS)  at UC Merced, had been                                        talking with area farmers about the challenges of growing almonds and grapes.

UC Merced Prof. Colleen Naughton received a CITRIS                                            COVID-19 Seed Fund to solve the disruption in the food supply chain. The                                        project aims to create more resilient and equitable systems within the food                                        supply chain by leveraging technology to improve the transfer of information,                                        data, and informatics.                                                                            In an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, many business and restaurant                                        closed and led to a decrease in demand for food of certain volumes and types.                                        This disruption was what Naughton calls “supply chain pinch points.” She is                                        using life cycle assessments and other systems analysis to identify areas of                                        improvement along the supply chain. Without being able to adapt for consumer                                        markets, food insecurity increased. Naughton and her team collaborated with                                        agriculture and community leaders to bridge the gap between farmers, food,                                        restaurants, retailers and the Merced County Food Bank. Long after the pandemic                                        is over, this research will help to bring together the community, farmers and                                        overall sustainability.

By running their AI model on recordings taken from across a bird habitat in Sonoma, they hope to distinguish between 45 different species of birds based on only their sound.","By Leigh Bernacchi, UC MercedBird species usually are counted twice a year by wildlife surveyors: once during                                        the breeding season and again during the                                             Christmas Bird Count  .New technology, however, is increasing the accuracy of bird population studies. A                                        team of UC Merced researchers is developing a model to recognize bird calls.Recording devices called AudioMoths have been placed across bird habitat in                                        Sonoma County. During two-week periods, the device wakes up every 10 minutes and                                        records one minute of sound.                                             Department of Computer Science and Engineering   Professor Shawn Newsam                                         and  Electrical Engineering and                                            Computer Science  graduate student Shrishail “Shree” Baligar are using                                        artificial intelligence (AI) to detect bird calls in the recordings.Their model can detect 45 different species so far, and will be used to produce                                        maps of where, when, and how many species are present.Newsam and several colleagues joined up to explore the idea with two recently                                        funded awards.“I love working on multidisciplinary problems. It charges me,” Newsam said. He                                        and Baligar are working with geography Professor Matthew Clark from Sonoma State                                        University, and Leo Salas, a quantitative ecologist at Point Blue Conservation                                        Science, a nonprofit focused on climate-smart conservation.“I’m excited to apply AI for the benefit of the Earth,” Newsam said. “Being able                                        to passively detect and map species distributions using low-cost audio recording                                        devices allows a range of down-stream research by domain scientists.”                                            The tiny AudioMoth recorders will capture recordings in nature, which can                                            later be used to teach a computer model to recognize bird sounds.                                        The “Soundscapes                                            to Landscapes (S2L): Monitoring Animal Biodiversity from Space Using Citizen                                            Scientists” program is supported by $1.1 million over three years                                        through NASA’s Citizen Science for Earth Systems program. It uses citizen                                        scientists to deploy the AudioMoths. Other birders knowledgeable in bird calls                                        will annotate a subset of the recordings, which serve as the training data for                                        the AI models.This summer, Newsam also received a $90,000, one-year “AI for Earth Innovation”                                        grant from Global Wildlife Conservation in partnership with Microsoft. The                                        nonprofit relies on research to work with local communities to address the root                                        causes of threats to wildlife.Newsam’s is one of only five projects funded out of 135 applications. The grant                                        supports AI projects that can scale quickly. The research will benefit many                                        other projects because it is open source.For Newsam, there are many questions about processing the data, and many                                        technical challenges. The recordings have biophony, geophony and anthrophony                                        noise, and the bird calls are often faint. Some species have different calls for                                        different communications: warning calls, mating calls and others. Which one                                        should the AI focus on?“Birds often modify their calls by changing frequency, for example, if other                                        birds are also calling,” Newsam said. “I am learning a lot about bird calls.”                                    Baligar hears the calls as something more than just bird communication.“I like to think of birds as musical instruments,” he said. “All the violins are                                        orange crowned warblers, but no two violins are the same. A bird song plays                                        different notes, and every bird likes to play a song differently every time.”                                    Each AudioMoth gathers about 2,000 minutes of data per site. So far, the team has                                        more than 500,000 minute-long recordings — more than 8,000 hours of data from                                        over 600 locations — and terrabytes of data to manage.However, training the AI model requires a lot of annotated data.“Deep learning is data hungry,” Baligar said. “The more data the better. On                                        average, we have just 650 training clips per bird species, which is not a lot.”                                    Newsam, who co-founded the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SpARC) at UC Merced,                                        is an expert in image analysis and understanding.“Image and audio are sensorily very different but in the end, it is just data —                                        data that we are turning into information through several processes,” he said.                                    Baligar did not set out to study sound or bird calls when he was a master’s                                        student. He was more interested in time-series questions. Now, audio over time                                        is the focus of his dissertation, and potentially the basis for a company he                                        hopes to launch after graduation.Computer science and environmental science are two of UC Merced’s growing number                                        of strengths, said                                             Professor Josh Viers, director of the  Center for Information Technology                                            Research in the Interest of Society  at UC Merced.“Professor Newsam’s research is indicative of the progress UC Merced has made in                                        attracting top talent and solving important global problems,” Viers said. “Shawn                                        is a leader in developing computer science tools that interpret and integrate                                        massive amounts of information, from Earth imagery to sound recordings, and his                                        research is pushing the envelope on innovation in sustainability and technology.                                        It is really exciting to see this example of artificial intelligence used to                                        benefit wildlife conservation efforts.”Future work for the team includes trying to identify individual birds and be able                                        to track them over their range.“If we can overcome some of the modeling challenges,” Newsam said, “we might be                                        able to replace satellites with much more fine-scaled information about all                                        kinds of wildlife.”",

The three applied for the grant to address an issue they                      noticed in the classes they teach at UC Merced.                                          “Some of my students struggle with basic computing                      principles,” Kyrilov said. “They grasp the structure and                      goals, but do not engage in the beauty of computing. It’s                      like the difference between plunking piano keys and                      playing the piano with expression and control.”                                          Kyrilov worked with the Merced County Office of Education                      and Merced Union High School District and found that few                      high school students were taking, much less passing, the                      advanced placement exams. He created coding resources and                      engaged with students but realized a longer-term strategy                      would be to work with the teachers.                                          Through the new grant, UC Merced undergraduates can                      participate in a course to support middle and high school                      teachers trying new computer science curricula. The class,                      taught by Kyrilov, will answer computer science questions                      and help build a network of teachers and undergraduate                      students.                                          “When it comes to inspiring young minds, computer science                      is today’s Tinker Toys and ERECTOR sets,”                      School of Engineering                      Dean Mark Matsumoto said. “We want students to see what                      doors computer science can open for them in the future.”                                          “This exciting cross-school partnership focuses our shared                      expertise on one of our primary goals — to improve K-12                      educational outcomes and train a skilled workforce for the                      San Joaquin Valley and beyond,”                                              School of Natural Sciences                                            Dean Betsy Dumont said. “It sets the stage for a wealth of                      future collaborations.”                                          Computer science and engineering is the second-largest                      undergraduate major at UC Merced, with more than 1,000                      students enrolled per year. Not all of them will work for                      tech giants or start their own companies — many will                      become teachers, too.                                          Carpin, the founding chair of the Department of Computer                      Science and Engineering at UC Merced, said he’s happy to                      see computer science studies growing and expanding to                      middle and high school students, and Arnold said she is                      most excited about engaging area teachers.                                          “This program opens the door for some of our students to                      share their enthusiasm for computer science with Valley                      middle and high school students,” she said. “This program                      is a way to address the problem through enhanced content                      knowledge and a robust support system for our diverse                      teachers to help them be even more prepared when they                      enter the classroom to teach computer science.”                                          The new program will support computer science educators                      from middle and high schools through in-person and online                      professional development and support from UC Merced. They                      will also help UC Merced conduct research about how the                      students learn and engage with the curricula. Teacher                      recruitment begins in early 2021, and each participating                      teacher will receive a $2,000 stipend upon completing the                      program.                                          “Evaluating the program throughout will enable us to know                      what works and what doesn’t,” Kyrilov said.                                          Data will be collected and analyzed by ERC Data in Fresno,                      an external evaluation team specializing in educational                      programs — after all, scaling up is what successful                      startups do.                                          For                                              Professor Josh Viers                                            , director of UC Merced’s                                              Center for Information Technology Research in the                        Interest of Society                                            (CITRIS), the proposal aligns with much of the work he and                      his colleagues have been conducting since the university                      began.                                          “We’re participating in a grand experiment: Can a large                      public university make a difference in the San Joaquin                      Valley? This NSF award is validation that our university                      is creating pathways for students to succeed in the jobs                      of the future and to give back to the communities from                      which they came,” he said.                                          CITRIS, which runs a middle school NexTech Robotics                      program taught by UC Merced students, supported the                      proposal development because of its focus on technology                      and dedication to improving diversity in technology.                                          Designed to address the shortage of math and science                      teachers in California’s schools, especially the San                      Joaquin Valley, CalTeach, which is part of the School of                      Natural Sciences, has graduated more than 150 UC Merced                      students and has alumni teaching from Mariposa to the Bay                      Area and from Los Angeles to Sacramento.                                          “We’re seeing an increase in computer science majors in                      our education classes,” Arnold said. “Our students gain                      exposure to teaching through many of our outreach                      programs, from Bobcat Summer Academy to the CalTeach                      Learning Lab, and they can see the potential to change                      young people’s lives through education.”                    ",
telehealth2,ACTIVATE Bringing Telehealth Services to Vulnerable Merced County Residents,https://citris.ucmerced.edu/news/telehealth2,2020-09-16 00:00:00,"ACTIVATE is partnering with Livingston Community Health, a clinic that serves mostly Latinx communities with primary and preventative health care services regardless of their ability to pay. UC Merced’s Health Sciences Research Center (HSRI), the UC’s CITRIS network, tech distributors, community-based organizations and government agencies are also taking part to reach people who are vulnerable to the worst outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic with the technology, skills and connections they need to access and use health services.","                      Researchers at the Center for Information Technology                      Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the                      Banatao Institute at the University of California have                      launched a new public-private pilot initiative to bring                      telehealth services to underserved rural residents in                      Merced County.

The San Joaquin Valley has had attention focused on some                      of its problems, including farmworkers and their increased                      exposure to COVID-19. But HSRI Director                                              Professor Deborah Wiebe                                            said this collaboration can lead to positive outcomes.                                          “This feels like a way to start turning the tide on issues                      people have been concerned with for many years, including                      lack of access to health care, vulnerable populations and                      health disparities,” she said. “This is one of the bright                      spots that emerges from the pandemic.”                                          ACTIVATE is co-led by Professor David Lindeman, director                      of CITRIS Health, and Katherine Kim, professor at the                      Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing and the School of                      Medicine at UC Davis.                                          “The patients we’re serving with ACTIVATE are some of the                      most vulnerable members of society, and not only to                      COVID-19,” Kim said. “Many are low-income, undocumented,                      Latinx agricultural workers — these communities have the                      least access to quality health care services.”                                          California’s rural San Joaquin Valley faces some of the                      worst health disparities in the state and country. Many                      residents lack access to basic health care, and service                      providers in the area have limited reach and coverage. The                      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s 2020 County Health                      Rankings recently ranked Merced County as among the “least                      healthy” counties in California. Community health workers,                      public health activists and local leaders are committed to                      progress on this front, focusing on investing in quality,                      affordable care that meets residents where they are and                      improves overall health outcomes in their community.                                          “We still have a long way to go, but things are beginning                      to line up in very important ways,” Wiebe said.                                          Though details have not been announced, HSRI affiliates                      will contribute to the partnership through translational                      research, public outreach and engagement, education and                      project evaluation.                                          “These are incredibly complex issues that cannot be                      addressed without all hands on deck,” Wiebe said. “What I                      love about ACTIVATE is that it’s a public-private project                      that can make progress in ways no single entity could.”                                          ACTIVATE will first launch at Livingston Community Health                      in Merced County, and is expected to rapidly expand                      throughout the state to other community health centers                      (CHCs) and clinicians who serve vulnerable populations.                      The goal is not just to provide the technology needed for                      telehealth and remote health monitoring, but also to                      ensure that patients are empowered to use it and see                      greater health outcomes as a result.                                          Program participants will receive health education and                      training in digital literacy as well as software and                      hardware (phones, tablets and other remote monitoring                      equipment) needed to connect with health care providers                      and monitor chronic health conditions. Building on health                      education from community health workers and medical                      assistants, the program emphasizes training of primary                      care practitioners in CHCs. These critical health care                      workers are at the front lines of health care in the era                      of COVID-19. They are embedded in the communities they                      serve and have the cultural and linguistic skills to break                      down barriers and help patients access physical and mental                      health services.                                          “The patients we serve are too often left out by                      traditional health system models,” Livingston Community                      Health CEO Leslie Abasta-Cummings said. “They live in                      rural areas and face financial, cultural, and legal                      barriers when it comes to accessing health care services.                      Working with these communities to embed and encourage the                      use of telehealth technology will empower patients to                      manage their own health and experience greater health                      outcomes.”                                          The ACTIVATE team will evaluate the pilot program for                      achieving goals in technology implementation, outreach,                      adoption and utilization; successful use of community                      health workers to reach patients; and improved health                      behavior and health care outcomes. Working with the Center                      for Connected Health Policy, ACTIVATE will develop a                      roadmap for post-pandemic sustainability of health system                      reforms that incorporate telehealth. Ultimately, ACTIVATE                      aims to demonstrate that telehealth has the power to serve                      rural and vulnerable communities, and encourage telehealth                      solutions as cost-effective means of enhancing                      community-based health systems.                                          “As we have seen our communities’ strain under the                      pandemic, it is clear that we need new approaches to                      solving the most pressing problems, especially in health                      care,” said                                              Professor Joshua Viers, director of                      CITRIS at UC Merced. “This commitment to improving telehealth shows the best                      that the University of California and Merced campus have                      to offer in serving the needs of our most vulnerable                      community members.”                    ",

Weekly synchronous and asynchronous virtual sessions will                      be held from Oct. 16 through Nov. 20 and are open to all.                                          “People seem to be more engaged in science right now,”                      Naughton said.                                          Naughton, who researches water, sanitation and hygiene in                      developing communities, among other topics, said her work                      on this conference — in the informed decisions and action                      theme — builds on a grant she recently received from the                                              Center for Information Technology Research in the                        Interest of Society                                            (CITRIS) to study wastewater and SARS-CoV-2.                                          She is working with UC Davis colleagues to research and                      map the risk of SARS-CoV-2 among people who work at                      wastewater treatment plants.                                          “They are essential workers, and can be exposed, because                      viruses can aerosolize and there are certain steps in                      wastewater treatment that require aeration of the                      effluent,” Naughton explained.

telehealth,"ACTIVATE Will Bring Telehealth Services To Vulnerable, At-Risk Residents of California’s Central Valley",https://citris.ucmerced.edu/news/telehealth,2020-09-10 00:00:00,"CITRIS Researchers are launching ACTIVATE, a public-private pilot initiative to bring telehealth services to underserved rural residents in Merced County, California.","                      September 10, 2020 (Berkeley, California) – Researchers at                      the Center for Information Technology Research in the                      Interest of Society & the Banatao Institute (CITRIS) at                      the University of California are launching today                      Accountability, Coordination, and Telehealth in the Valley                      to Achieve Transformation and Equity (ACTIVATE), a                      public-private pilot initiative to bring telehealth                      services to underserved rural residents in Merced County,                      California. In partnership with                      Livingston Community Health, the University of California CITRIS network, technology                      distributors, community-based organizations, and                      government agencies, ACTIVATE aims to reach populations                      who are vulnerable to the worst outcomes of the COVID-19                      pandemic with the technology, skills, and connections they                      need to access and utilize health care services.                                          ACTIVATE is co-led by                      Dr. David Lindeman, Director of CITRIS Health, and                      Dr. Katherine Kim, Associate Professor at the Betty Irene Moore School of                      Nursing and the School of Medicine at the University of                      California, Davis.                                          “The patients we’re serving with ACTIVATE are some of the                      most vulnerable members of society, and not only to                      COVID-19,” said Kim. “Many are low-income, undocumented,                      Latinx agricultural workers – these communities have the                      least access to quality health care services.”                                          California’s rural Central Valley faces some of the worst                      health disparities in the state and country. Many                      residents of the Valley lack access to basic health care,                      and service providers in the area have limited reach and                      coverage. The                      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s                      2020 County Health Rankings recently ranked Merced County                      as among the “least healthy” counties with adverse health                      outcomes in California. Community health workers, public                      health activists, and local leaders are committed to                      progress on this front, focusing on investing in quality,                      affordable care that meets residents where they are and                      improves overall health outcomes in their community.                                          ACTIVATE will first launch at Livingston Community Health                      in Merced County, and is expected to rapidly expand                      throughout the state to other community health centers                      (CHCs) and clinicians that serve vulnerable populations.                      The goal of the pilot program is not just to provide the                      technology needed for telehealth and remote health                      monitoring, but also to ensure that patients are empowered                      to use it and see greater health outcomes as a result. To                      that end, program participants will receive health                      education and training in digital literacy as well as                      software and hardware (phones, tablets, and other remote                      monitoring equipment) needed to connect with health care                      providers and monitor chronic health conditions. Building                      on health education from community health workers and                      medical assistants based at the CHC, the program                      emphasizes training of primary care practitioners in CHCs.                      These critical health care workers are at the front lines                      of health care in the era of COVID-19. They are embedded                      in the communities they serve, and have the cultural and                      linguistic skills to break down barriers and help patients                      access physical and mental health services.                                          “The patients we serve are too often left out by                      traditional health system models,” said Livingston                      Community Health CEO Leslie Abasta-Cummings. “They live in                      rural areas and face financial, cultural, and legal                      barriers when it comes to accessing health care services.                      Working with these communities to embed and encourage the                      use of telehealth technology will empower patients to                      manage their own health and experience greater health                      outcomes.”                                          In collaboration with Livingston Community Health, the                      program will be implemented and evaluated by a coalition                      of experts through CITRIS’s University of California                      multi-campus network including experts from UC Berkeley,                      UC Davis, and UC Merced.                                          “Telehealth represents a safe and effective way for many                      populations, including rural and low-income communities,                      to access necessary health care services – especially                      during a pandemic,” said Dr. David Lubarsky, Vice                      Chancellor of Human Health Sciences and CEO of                      UC Davis Health. “UC Davis Health is committed to using our expertise to                      improve the health of those who live and work in our                      state. Through the ACTIVATE project, we will offer                      resources and expertise to identify the best ways to                      deliver telehealth services to providers serving the most                      vulnerable populations. Ultimately, we plan to provide a                      roadmap for both public and private partners, setting a                      gold standard in California and across the nation.”                                          The ACTIVATE team will evaluate the pilot program for                      achieving goals in technology implementation, outreach,                      adoption and utilization; successful use of community                      health workers to reach patients; and improved health                      behavior and health care outcomes. Working with the                      Center for Connected Health Policy, ACTIVATE will develop a roadmap for post-pandemic                      sustainability of health system reforms that incorporate                      telehealth. Ultimately, ACTIVATE aims to demonstrate that                      telehealth has the power to serve rural and vulnerable                      communities, and encourage telehealth solutions as                      cost-effective means of enhancing community-based health                      systems.                                          The Center for Information Technology Research in the                      Interest of Society & the Banatao Institute (CITRIS),                      based at the University of California, was created in 2001                      to leverage world-class research to develop technology                      solutions to society’s biggest challenges. CITRIS’s UC                      experts have years of experience working on issues related                      to health care access and digital inclusion. Livingston                      Community Health is a Merced County-based clinic that                      serves mostly Latinx communities with primary and                      preventative health care services regardless of their                      ability to pay.

solar,Kurtz Leads Project to Efficiently Store Renewable Energy,https://citris.ucmerced.edu/news/renewable-solar,2020-08-20 00:00:00,"Professor Kurtz of UCMerced is leading a new $1.25 million project called “Modeling of Long-duration Storage for Decarbonization of the California Energy System,” funded by the California Energy Commission. The CEC granted 13 projects with more than $30 million total to find ways to store energy generated by solar collection for 10 to 24 hours — the critical period to overcome rainy and overcast days. Kurtz and her team are looking for ways to site storage and provide greater electric-grid stability to help the CEC make decisions. The researchers will look at a year’s worth of data and seek cost-effective ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the state’s energy stability.","                                        California’s leaders want the state to reach 100 percent clean energy in the                                        future, including being 60 percent powered by renewable energy by 2030 and being                                        free of fossil fuels entirely by 2045.                                        But if the state wants power without fossil fuels, School of Engineering Professor Sarah                                        Kurtz said, there must still be a balance between the state’s supply of and                                        demand for electricity.                                                                            Consumers rely on a steady supply of energy, but renewable energy solutions are                                        variable. Solar power is great, but what happens on overcast days? Or at night?                                        Wind generates energy, too, but what happens when the wind isn’t blowing?                                                                            “Optimizing costly storage enables us to overcome the barriers of long-term wind                                        and solar shortages,” Kurtz said. “Short-term storage helps as the sun is                                        setting and people are cooking supper. Long-term storage, between 10 and 100                                        hours, gets you through a storm, fog or a hot, still summer night.”                                                                            Right now, storage is expensive. Optimizing investments in batteries and other                                        forms of energy storage will help overcome what Kurtz calls the biggest barrier                                        to successful transition to a clean grid.                                                                            “My goal is to help the state meet its zero-carbon goal without increasing                                        costs. I can help by identifying pathways that would enable us to get there                                        faster and with lower costs,” Kurtz said.                                                                            Modeling different options, costs and outcomes helps determine the value-driven                                        solutions. But optimizing investments requires supercomputing and modeling with                                        a huge number of variables, from costs to location to timing.                                                                            That’s why Kurtz is leading a new $1.25 million project called “Modeling of                                        Long-duration Storage for Decarbonization of the California Energy System,”                                        funded by the California Energy Commission.

The team, which includes faculty members and graduate students from UC Merced,                                        UC Berkeley and the University of North Carolina, will work on quantifying the                                        role of storage for California as it invests in storage to reach its zero-carbon                                        goal.                                                                            “If you want to be able to run the state of California on renewable energy and                                        you don’t want to use fossil fuels, you have to find novel ways of managing the                                        grid. For example, if you know in January it gets foggy for the whole day. No                                        sun, no wind. How are you going to power the state during that time?” Kurtz                                        said. “That’s the challenge we need to address.”                                                                            The Golden State receives plenty of sunshine and it has the most solar                                        infrastructure of any state — enough to solar power nearly 8 million homes.                                        Going forward, nearly all newly constructed homes built will be equipped with                                        solar panels under state law.                                        Wind and solar work well together: The wind tends to blow most at night.                                                                            “Currently, solar provides 20 percent of the electricity generated in                                        California, while wind provides only about 7 percent,” Kurtz said. “If we built                                        more wind farms, we typically would need less storage to get through the night.”                                                                            Kurtz and her team are looking for ways to site storage and provide greater                                        electric-grid stability to help the CEC make decisions.

Kurtz brings her legacy of three decades of leading research at the National                                        Renewable Energy Lab and having invented key components of multi-junction solar                                        cells — which have been used on interplanetary space missions — to the new                                        project. Her peers recognized the power of her transformational work by electing                                        her to engineering’s most prestigious organization, the National Academy of                                        Engineering.                                                                            From biofuels to photovoltaics, UC Merced is an ideal place to conduct renewable                                        energy research, the faculty say, because of the abundance of sunshine. As the                                        home of UC Solar and a branch of the Center for Information Technology Research                                        in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) , several faculty members are working to                                        transform the world’s renewable energy systems.                                                                            “I came to UC Merced to build on our sustainability and engineering programs,”                                        Kurtz said. But she has a higher aim than that, too. “The beautiful thing about                                        renewable energy is the more you use it the cheaper it gets, which paves a path                                        to prosperity for the world.”                                    ",

In December, McBride was heading to southeast Asia to connect with colleagues                                    interested in expanding human consciousness and potential. As the Director of the                                    Social Reality and Cognition International Research Group, McBride seeks to answer                                    deep philosophical questions about how social theory is needed to understand the                                    structure of social reality, especially in startups and businesses. “The goal is to                                    one day have a theory for understanding the social world that compares to the                                    framework we have for understanding the physical world. It’s an embarrassing secret                                    that we’ve got nothing right now,” McBride said. Knowing that the                                         Center for Information Technology in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the                                        Banatao Institute  collaborates with                                         PCARI, the Philippine-California Advanced Research Institute, McBride                                    reached out to the                                         Philippines Development Foundation .                                                                                                                                                    Excitement for his entrepreneurial research spread, resulting in 12 talks. “I                                        was expecting a one lecture ‘fly by’ but there is a real thirst for                                        entrepreneurial results in poverty-stricken Philippines.”                                                                            “Saint Louis University is in a town built on beautiful forested hills,” McBride                                        said. “I would have loved to have spent more time up there.” But he had to keep                                        going on the entrepreneurship roadshow, including one “hideous five-hour drive                                        on bumpy, curvy jungle roads so bad that one passenger got sick in a sandwich                                        bag.”                                                                                Manila, Philippines                                                                                Criss-crossing the Philippines by car, bus, train and plane, McBride visited six                                        universities, meeting with university presidents, faculty, engineering groups,                                        and students.                                                                            The undergraduates he met were excited about doing real projects to make real                                        money, as McBride has his UC Merced entrepreneurship students do. On the first                                        day of his popular class, he tells his students go out and make $12,000 profit                                        by the end of the semester or provide $12,000 in social good for the community.                                        And they do — through fancy shoe sales, welcome-baby kits for single mothers,                                        real estate, selling insurance, cutting hair, or designing and licensing                                        products.                                                                            The Philippine government wants to reduce the rampant poverty in the country                                        through entrepreneurship. The government and university leaders were intrigued                                        by McBride’s debunking of the popular LEAN Startup technique, where products are                                        iterated through customer feedback. “It’s dawning on incubators around the world                                        that the standard entrepreneurship recipes are just not working,” McBride said.                                        His alternative approach, ‘Functional Entrepreneurship’ involves creating                                        agreements between people who assume rights and duties on behalf of the venture,                                        social agreements that have not existed before.                                                                            “My favorite example is the famous Microsoft-IBM deal. IBM needed an operating                                        system and Gates agreed to provide one.” McBride said. “Of course, Gates didn’t                                        have one, had no idea how to get one, and couldn’t build one. But he got lucky                                        and found one and negotiated a deal to buy it under a single company license but                                        set up the other agreement with IBM to pay for every copy sold on every single                                        computer.” These two simple agreements Gates designed later made Microsoft the                                        largest company in the world.                                                                            Social agreements are the atomic pieces from which all ventures are built.                                        Students have lots of practice consuming agreements that others design but                                        little experience designing their own. Practicing novel agreements can help                                        students overcome barriers to entering businesses. And those new connections                                        crafted to their benefit are what make it possible for many to rise out of                                        poverty.                                                                            “The culture of the Philippines poses some unique challenges to                                        entrepreneurship,” McBride said. “There are wonderful, deep family ties, but if                                        you only trust your family and friends for entrepreneurial advice, you won’t be                                        successful. When you’re trying to build something neither you nor anyone you                                        know has ever built before, it helps to be overly optimistic, and respectfully                                        ignore those who are telling you to be ‘realistic’. ‘Realists’ didn’t discover                                        the lightbulb, build Apple, discover special relativity, or build a new UC.”                                                                            When asked about gender dynamics in the Philippines, McBride said, “gender roles                                        in the Philippines discourage female entrepreneurs more than the U.S. but it’s                                        important to realize that sexism is a universal problem. I ran a study with                                        venture capital investments in hypothetical companies where the entire                                        investment packet was the same except for the picture of the CEO, chosen to be                                        either a male or a female. There was a huge difference in money invested,                                        depending on the sex of the CEO. It’s a serious problem.”                                                                            But there are reasons for hope, according to McBride: “If Functional                                        Entrepreneurship is correct, then it’s all about communicating to build new                                        social agreements and studies show that women often excel in communication                                        skills.” Additionally, China can serve as an interesting role model for both the                                        U.S. and the cultural challenge in the Philippines: “It’s seems almost                                        impossible to find a female under 30 in China who is not opening a store, buying                                        real estate, and day trading. It’s a completely different baseline expectation                                        compared to the U.S. or the Philippines and, one that we can both learn from.”                                                                            McBride plans to return to the Philippines to work on policy and pedagogy of                                        entrepreneurship. His roadshow inspired students to try new social agreements                                        and see themselves as catalysts in their own novel business ventures.

Economist Stephen Newbold of the University of Wyoming is leading the transdisciplinary team working on water quality management. The project team includes Sarah Lindley and Shannon Albeke (University of Wyoming), Joshua Viers (University of California, Merced), Robert Johnston (Clark University), and George Parsons (University of Delaware).","                      Summertime means fun in the water. As temperatures                      increase, algal blooms may grow in freshwater and marine                      ecosystems. Some algae are natural and life-giving, while                      others are the result of life out of balance and can have                      harmful effects. Consisting of bacteria and tiny plankton,                      they arise quickly and alter the ecosystem by consuming                      available oxygen, killing fish. They also pose a human                      health risk as some of the algal blooms emit                      toxins—including                                              neurotoxins deadly to pets                      and harmful to people. Detecting algal blooms from space                      is one way to prevent exposure. Analyzing how people react                      to harmful algal blooms in another.                                            Resources for the Future and NASA partnered to evaluate                        the socioeconomic benefits of satellites.                                            The Valuables program quantifies the benefits of using                      satellite data in decisions that improve socioeconomic                      benefits for people and the environment, including water                      quality.                                          In an innovative and cross-disciplinary remote-sensing                      approach,                                              UC Merced Professor Josh Viers                      aims to develop a model that describes how lake visitors                      in California adjust their recreation choices when                      outbreaks of harmful algal blooms are announced. Viers                      also serves as Associate Dean for Research in the School                      of Engineering and Campus Director of the                                              Center for Information Technology Research in the                        Interest of Society.                      This project will improve our current understanding of how                      early warning systems supported by satellite data allow                      recreators to divert their visits away from water bodies                      currently experiencing a bloom, and instead visit                      un-impacted sites, thereby increasing the overall                      enjoyment of water-based recreation activities, reducing                      the risks of adverse health effects, and mitigating the                      regional economic impacts associated with lost visitation                      days. “The important breakthrough in this research will be                      to put a dollar value on the economic benefit of                      information technology applied to environmental problems                      that directly affect things we value, like recreation and                      water quality,” said Viers.

Selected from more than 95                      proposals, the UC Merced technology projects highlight                      campus strengths in engineering and health. See the full                      list of                                              25 projects here.                      The School of Engineering ranks 137th in the country, due                      in part to the creativity of faculty members such as                                              Professor Colleen Naughton.                      Recognizing the duration of the pandemic and its impact on                      basic services such as garbage collection and disposal or                      water and electricity, Naughton jumped on a unique class                      of essential workers and their families and communities.                                          “Like many of you, the pandemic has made me feel anxious.                      I wanted to use my skills to help,” Naughton said. “From                      previous work, I knew treatment workers and communities                      near treatment plants are at higher risk for exposure to                      pathogens, so I want to help protect them against COVID-19                      too.”                                          The virus has been detected in wastewater across the                      globe. Naughton will bring her expertise in water                      sanitation and mapping that she first developed as a Peace                      Corps volunteer in Mali. With her colleague at UC Davis,                      Professor Maureen Kinyua, they will quantify and create                      visual maps of risk around 38 wastewater treatment plants                      in the Bay Area.                                          Another project that intersects engineering and health is                      the mobile, low-cost, scalable, user-friendly sanitizer                      for various applications, proposed by UC Merced                      engineering                                              Professor Reza Ehsani.                                            Ozone, a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms that                      forms a protective barrier to ultraviolet light in the                      atmosphere, is currently used in food processing to reduce                      microbes. Ehsani proposes repurposing and redesigning                      ozone generators for sanitation of indoor areas for food                      and agriculture. He hopes to have a prototype by the end                      of the summer.                                          On the immediate health front, two awards will address                      developing antibody detection and assess telehealth.                                          “UC Merced's health sciences faculty are a tremendous                      resource for addressing the COVID-19 threat,” Director of                                              Health Sciences Research Institute                      Professor Deb Wiebe said. “Our scientists rapidly have                      heeded the call to be part of the solution through a range                      of multidisciplinary research endeavors, including                      antiviral development, mathematical models to understand                      viral spread and making telehealth information available                      to rural communities.”                                          Public health                                              Professor Denise Payan                      is working with professors Hector Rodriguez from UC                      Berkeley and Lorena Garcia from UC Davis to ensure that                      those most in need of health care and most at risk if                      exposed to coronavirus have access to telehealth                      resources. The project calls for building a new database                      for tracking telehealth use among low-income Californians                      with chronic conditions and will help make immediate                      changes to telehealth as needed.                                          A team of Bioengineering faculty are creating the key to                      opening society.                                              Professors Wei-Chun Chin,                                              Changqing Li                      and                                              Jennifer Lu                      are working to rapidly develop antibody testing to help                      determine who is “safe.” There have been several                      limitations in testing, including delay of results —                      sometimes up to two weeks — false negatives, high cost and                      lack of materials. The team will address all these issues                      by using low-cost carbon materials to create a test that                      reads results within seconds. They will use graphene and                      carbon nanotubes that look like a rolled up honeycomb.                      These carbon-based conductive materials have several                      benefits, including providing direct electrical readouts                      instead of requiring testing solutions and rinsing.                                          “These grants not only reflect the science and engineering                      prowess of our faculty but also clearly demonstrate their                      willingness to engage in research around societal problems                      such as COVID-19,” UC Merced Vice Chancellor of Research                      Sam Traina said.                                          In addition to seed funding,                                              CITRIS and the Banatao Institute, a multi-campus research institute of the University of                      California has undertaken other efforts to address the                      pandemic by mobilizing the CITRIS Invention Lab, a makers                      space, to fabricate ventilator adaptors to convert                      consumer-grade sleep apnea devices for clinical use.                      Throughout its 20-year history, CITRIS has developed                      technology solutions to respond to society’s greatest                      problems.                    ",

To meet the needs of new students, training goes beyond research and academics. In                                    addition,                                    the bridge program provides crucial training in life skills such as budgeting,                                    studying, and stress management needed for                                    success at the university.

Joel Kimmelshue, Ph.D., a founding partner and the                      principal soil and agriculture scientist at Land IQ in                      Sacramento, will offer a talk entitled “Agricultural Land                      Classification and Crop Water Use: The Importance of                      Ground Truthing for Calibration and Validation.”                     Land IQ  has                      developed a statewide land-use mapping program for the                      California Department of Water Resources that implements                      comprehensive ground-truthing — observations of ground                      conditions in situ — for calibrating and validating models                      based on remotely sensed data for the ultimate                      classification of all agricultural fields in California.                      This talk introduces the importance of comprehensive                      ground truthing to ensure accuracy for both the remotely                      sensed agricultural land use mapping and crop-consumed                      water estimates.

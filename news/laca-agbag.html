                                    Over the past few decades, technology has rapidly advanced with new mind-blowing
                                    innovations that reshape the way we live our lives. From cell phones to computers,
                                    the very internet we collaborate through are all thanks to the advances we have
                                    made. They changed the way we connect with others and understand our world, however,
                                    they aren’t the only ones. Another advancement that had changed our world
                                    dramatically has been right under our noses since the beginning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With funding and collaboration through LACA, Kenney and Anne Visser have been
                                    researching in advancements in digital platforms and mechanization made to modern
                                    agriculture. We have been able to create systems that are automated to build cars
                                    and other machines but sometimes that may translate strangely to agriculture. For
                                    example, strawberries and automation have had a troubled relationship, where
                                    backbreaking labor would most benefit from a technological intervention. Due to the
                                    complexities of strawberries, their ripeness timing, and other factors trying to
                                    automate them tends to be a problem. Currently, most strawberry farmers are looking
                                    more into genetically modification to make strawberries easier for machines to
                                    recognize as being ripe or to ripen regularly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Visser also discussed combine harvesters used for grains. Many in the Ag-Tech field
                                    would like to increase digitization and make combine harvesters more automated. This
                                    way collecting grains will not be as much of an effort for farmers and create jobs
                                    that focus on caring for these systems. These are just some of the ways those within
                                    the Ag-Tech field want to try to change the way we go about agriculture and create
                                    more satisfying jobs for workers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ag-Tech is changing the way we farm. Ag-Tech has enabled the rapid development of
                                    agriculture with combine harvesters to increase harvesting and irrigation that
                                    enables watering in a grand scale. By continuing to advance technology for
                                    agriculture we can create a sustainable environment for people to thrive and more
                                    sustained job opportunities that are more rewarding and safer for farm laborers. The
                                    use of Ag-Tech is beneficial not only for the environment but also the people around
                                    them. With Ag-Tech you can not only improve crop production but also limit the
                                    amount of chemicals and water to only what’s necessary making it safe for the farmer
                                    and workers. With a focus shifting away from intensive labor the need to assist
                                    these systems will go to current farmers who would still need to check and take care
                                    not for every individual plant but for the machines that look after them. This means
                                    that more job opportunities will be made for farmers and diverse job avenues for
                                    them benefitting not only them but their communities as well. Unfortunately, there
                                    has been controversy around these advancements.

                                    There are topics regarding further development of agriculture that need to be
                                    discussed as stated by Visser, “there are important consequences as it relates to
                                    questions of equity and socioeconomic inequalities, and the way in which the
                                    intersection of race, class, gender environment, place of residence, et cetera, all
                                    will interplay.” Ultimately, Professor Visser left this discussion to the audience
                                    to decide whether or not the future of agriculture should be pursued in such a way.
                                    There will always be consequences to our actions but do those consequences truly
                                    outweigh the benefits? I personally disagree, I think the further development of
                                    agriculture can do more good than harm.

                                    From my perspective, as a student at UC Merced, given the turbulence of COVID-19
                                    pandemic protecting crops and farmer lives are vital for communities and society. We
                                    should be protecting those who tend to the food we eat and help protect those whose
                                    lives are at risk. With the growth of Ag-Tech and the help of LACA we can make that
                                    future possible. We can change the way we do agriculture to benefit society as a
                                    whole and save others when a new outbreak or challenge comes our way.

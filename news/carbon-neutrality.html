                                    <p>After a lengthy and rigorous review by independent auditors, UC Merced can
                                        proudly announce it is the first public research university in the country to
                                        achieve carbon neutrality, two years ahead of its goal.</p>

                                    <p>“UC Merced has been on the cutting edge of sustainability in higher education
                                        since its inception. We are proud of our many achievements in reducing our
                                        impact on the environment, and this recognition of our carbon neutrality stands
                                        among the most meaningful we have yet received,” Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz
                                        said.</p>

                                    <p>The campus actually achieved carbon neutrality in 2018, seven years before former

                                            Janet Napolitano’s initiative</a> goal to have all 10 campuses carbon
                                        neutral by 2025. However, the emissions verification and validation take time.
                                        UC Merced retained a third-party verifier to review and audit the campus
                                        inventories of greenhouse gas emissions specifically from onsite fossil fuel
                                        combustion and purchased electricity.</p>
                                    <p>“This was a voluntary step we took, and usually take, to ensure accuracy and

                                        “We wanted to ensure we reflected the full spectrum of our campus emissions
                                        profile.”</p>
                                    <p>The inventory results are reported to The Climate Registry (TCR), which conducts
                                        its own review. TCR is a nonprofit organization with a mission of empowering its
                                        members to reduce their carbon footprints. It does not certify organizations as
                                        carbon neutral, but rather works with member organizations to measure, report
                                        and verify their carbon footprints.</p>
                                    <p>“I’m very proud that our university has achieved carbon-neutral campus operations
                                        and hope we can be an inspiration for others across the state and nation,” said

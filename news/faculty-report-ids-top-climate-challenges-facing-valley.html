                                            Assessment says. Fewer winter chill hours will affect many of the productive
                                            orchards throughout the Valley and foothills, and all agricultural
                                            production will be affected by water availability, increased evaporative
                                            demands and extreme heat. Reduced crop yields and changes in timing of
                                            cropping systems may affect the regional economy and employment.

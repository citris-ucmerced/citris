                                    <p>A team from the University of California, Merced comprising eight undergraduate
                                        and graduate students has won the inaugural <a
                                            href="https://citris-uc.org/labs-programs/aviation-and-uav-facilities/citris-aviation-prize-2021/">CITRIS
                                            Aviation Prize</a>. For engineering the winning proposal, they will receive
                                        a $2,000 cash award, as well as a $25,000 budget to support a live demonstration
                                        of their flight in spring 2022.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Launched in fall 2021 by the Center for Information Technology Research in the
                                        Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute (CITRIS), in collaboration with
                                        the UC Berkeley Institute for Transportation Studies (ITS), the CITRIS Aviation
                                        Prize challenges student teams across the CITRIS campuses at Berkeley, Davis,
                                        Merced and Santa Cruz to design and develop a plan for an autonomous flight of
                                        at least 115 miles within a circuit of at least 5 miles with a small uncrewed
                                        aircraft system (UAV), or drone — in full compliance with <a
                                            href="https://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=22615"
                                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 107 rules</a> provided by the
                                        Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). </p>



                                    <p>The winning team submitted a proposal for a “long endurance edge-AI platform for
                                        research opportunities and data gathering,” called Project LEAP-FROG. In
                                        addition to the 115-mile-long endurance flight, they proposed to measure the
                                        amount of residual dry matter, or old plant material left on the ground at the
                                        beginning of a new growing season, over 200 acres of rural environments.</p>



                                    <p>&#8220;Our team is honored to have been selected for this prize, and we look
                                        forward to working with the CITRIS community to demonstrate our flight this
                                        spring,” said Derek Hollenbeck, team lead for Project LEAP-FROG and a doctoral
                                        student in mechanical engineering at UC Merced.</p>

                                        only and offers a generous amount of uncontrolled Class G airspace, making it an
                                        ideal location both to mitigate risk associated with the test flight and to
                                        approximate real-world research conditions. </p>

                                        on top of a unique hybrid vertical take-off and landing platform, but I’m

                                        praised all seven proposals submitted. “It is inspiring to see such innovation
                                        and enthusiasm from student teams across the four CITRIS campuses to meet the
                                        high bar established for this inaugural challenge,” he said. “We look forward to
                                        bringing together talent to see a successful flight in the spring and inspire
                                        more engagement from students and faculty in the future.”</p>



                                    <p>While the Project LEAP-FROG team will lead the spring demo, CITRIS invites
                                        faculty, staff and the other Aviation Prize competitors to help make the flight
                                        a success. To get involved, email <a

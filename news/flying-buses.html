                                    Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute (CITRIS)
                                    that convenes faculty and staff researchers from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Merced
                                    and UC Santa Cruz to integrate and enhance expertise in technologies, applications
                                    and policies related to vehicles for flight.</p>

                                    initiative, which <a

                                        launched in fall 2021</a>.</p>
                                <p>“The systemwide drone use policy hub is at Merced, and UC Davis has good aviation and
                                    noise modeling capabilities,” Sengupta said. “We’re trying to build a statewide

                                <p><strong>Moving people and packages in new ways and spaces</strong></p>
                                <p>Advanced air mobility (AAM) describes a system of air transportation that moves
                                    people and goods in modes and environments previously underserved by traditional
                                    aviation. For many, AAM brings to mind headlines about companies using drones to
                                    drop packages on people’s doorsteps, but the field involves a wide array of transit
                                    niches and emerging technologies, with applications in passenger mobility, freight
                                    delivery and emergency response.</p>
                                <p>AAM requires the creation of new air corridors, or mapped pathways through which
                                    vehicles can safely travel. The establishment and regulation of these corridors
                                    requires careful planning, especially in areas that already have busy skies and
                                    crowded streets.</p>
                                <p>The Caltrans project focuses on urban air mobility (UAM), which involves flight
                                    traffic in densely populated areas and often includes passenger travel, and also
                                    addresses flights that move cargo too large to be carried by drones.</p>
                                <p>Sengupta and team are approaching the project from both quantitative and qualitative
                                    angles. The first track, led by Bayen, concentrates on the digital tools needed to
                                    create an accurate simulation of UAM, including potential air corridors, safety
                                    issues and environmental impacts. While the skies of the Bay Area will serve as
                                    their case study, the tool set will be suitable for use across the state of
                                    California — and beyond.</p>
                                <p>The second track, led by Shaheen, aims to better understand the needs of key
                                    stakeholders, such as government agencies, regulators and corporations, and will
                                    produce briefs and manuals for stakeholders intending to implement AAM in their
                                    regions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Assessing noise and safety concerns</strong></p>
                                <p>The aircraft used for AAM will vary by cargo and travel requirements, but they are
                                    generally expected to be hybrid or electric vehicles that generate fewer emissions
                                    than traditional airplanes. Multirotor systems will likely proliferate due to their
                                    vertical take-off and landing capabilities, as well as their overall versatility.
                                </p>
                                <p>“Many people compare the UAM noise of rotating propellers to a helicopter,” Lee said.
                                    “Helicopters are so loud that they can’t fly in urban areas. Urban air mobility will
                                    be quieter because urban aircraft blades will be shorter, and noise is proportional
                                    to tip speed.</p>
                                <p>“However, air taxis will have multiple air rotors. They will also fly at lower
                                    altitudes than helicopters do. As a result, noise pollution may still be an issue.”
                                </p>
                                <p>Lee will use UCD-QuietFly, software that he developed to predict noise pollution, <a
                                        href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu/news/simulating-impact-air-taxis-california"> to
                                    </a> <a href="https://mae.ucdavis.edu/news/simulating-impact-air-taxis-california">
                                        create a “noise map.” </a> This assessment will account for the number of
                                    aircraft in the area, the heights of nearby buildings and the amount of noise
                                    generated by each aircraft, to give policymakers an idea how AAM noise will compare
                                    to ground traffic.</p>
                                <p>The dangers associated with AAM extend beyond noise pollution, however, and include
                                    risks to passengers, the public, and people who maintain equipment and facilities.
                                    As ​​director of the UC Center of Excellence on Unmanned Aircraft System Safety,
                                    Stark is an expert on aircraft safety, particularly the autonomous or
                                    semi-autonomous uncrewed vehicle systems, aka UASs or drones, that are likely to
                                    constitute the bulk of AAM fleets.</p>
                                <p>Using existing research from NASA, the international Joint Authorities for Rulemaking
                                    on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and other agencies, Stark will identify key metrics and
                                    analytic tools to provide meaningful safety data for future policymakers.</p>
                                <p>“This simulation will be useful to make good policy decisions,” Stark said. “We have
                                    to understand what advanced air mobility means for our community so that we can give
                                    this information to local governments.”</p>
                                <p><strong>Laying strong groundwork</strong></p>
                                <p>The researchers intend to incorporate stakeholder input from beginning to end.
                                    Shaheen, co-director of the UC Berkeley Transportation Sustainability Research
                                    Center (TSRC) and a pioneer in future mobility strategies, will lead the effort to
                                    conduct expert interviews to determine the information that planning and policy
                                    staff, regulators, and agencies will need to enable AAM.</p>
                                <p>“The goal is to foster shared understanding of roles and responsibilities and develop
                                    best practices for the development and approval of AAM corridors,” Shaheen said.</p>
                                <p>This track of research will also include group discussions with stakeholders,
                                    workshops to review the simulation’s progress and the production of policy briefs
                                    for stakeholders to use for their AAM implementations.</p>
                                <p>While the team will lay a strong qualitative and quantitative foundation for the
                                    adoption of advanced air mobility adoption in California, they do not expect to
                                    address every concern related to such a complex topic.</p>
                                <p>“There are energy issues, charging issues, environmental issues,” Sengupta said. “But
                                    our project doesn’t have to solve these problems. We must instead innovate the
                                    processes and tools the planners will use to solve them.”</p>

                        FLY CITRIS, an innovative drone education program run by CITRIS, was showcased during a workshop at
                        the 10th annual Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Conference organized by the Society of Women
                        Engineers on Saturday, March 18, 2024. The conference, hosted in person at the UC Merced campus,
                        aims to inspire middle and high school girls to explore opportunities in science, technology, engineering,
                        and mathematics (STEM). Participants immersed themselves in hands-on activities, through manual
                        flying and an engaging drone obstacle course. These activities foster teamwork, spatial thinking, and
                        mission planning skills, while promoting opportunities in STEM.

                        During the conference, attendees had the opportunity to experience FLY CITRIS firsthand, along with
                        other engaging workshops and talks hosted by various organizations across the UC Merced campus. This
                        included a panel talk focusing on “Women in STEM,” featuring CITRIS Director Dr. Erin Hestir.

                        "CITRIS is proud to once again support SWE in their important efforts to nurture girls' interests in math
                        and science and careers in science, technology, engineering and math,” said Dr. Hestir. “We look
                        forward to a future where our tech workforce is more diverse, more inclusive, and filled with brilliant
                        young minds like those we saw today."

                        The conference aims to provide young girls with exposure to STEM fields and inspire them to pursue
                        careers in these areas. Eleanor King, CITRIS Outreach and Education Coordinator, said about the
                        workshop, “It’s exciting to engage with future scientists, engineers, and drone pilots as they get to fly for
                        the first time. We hope to continue running workshops like FLY that provide even more students with
                        the opportunity to explore new STEM pathways.”

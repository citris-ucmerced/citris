                                    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/news/citris-uc.org">Center for
                                            Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao
                                            Institute</a>&nbsp;focuses on research and innovation across four UC
                                        campuses. UC Merced faculty are involved in three new proposals to address
                                        society&rsquo;s&mdash;and the San Joaquin Valley&rsquo;s&mdash;problems through
                                        technology: agriculture, health, and access to STEM careers. The&nbsp;<a
                                            href="https://citris-uc.org/2020-citris-core-seed-funding-awards-announced/">CITRIS
                                            Core Seed Fund awards</a>&nbsp;are each $60,000 and will be used to catapult
                                        research into actionable results within a year. Of the 68 proposals, seven teams
                                        were awarded, including three with UC Merced researchers.</p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>In April, the CITRIS Seed funds were distributed in the service of COVID 19</p>
                                    <p>CITRIS UC Merced&rsquo;s Director Joshua Viers said, &ldquo;These seed funds
                                        often grow into the large proposals that make changes to society. I could not be
                                        happier that we&rsquo;re leveraging UC Merced&rsquo;s strengths in health and
                                        agriculture and serving underrepresented students through mentorship with these
                                        proposals and look forward to expanding this work.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Professor Catherine Keske, UC Merced Director of the new National Science
                                        Foundation Engineering Research Center IoT4Ag (internet of things for
                                        agriculture) will assess the digital nature of modern agriculture. From
                                        precision applications to yield monitors, massive amounts of data are collected
                                        on farms. With Martin Kenney and Anne Visser from UC Davis and John Zysman from
                                        UC Berkeley, the team will review digital platforms for agricultural data by
                                        interviewing the developers and users and reviewing the literature.</p>
                                    <p>A second award focuses on a key barrier to independent living for older adults:
                                        the risk of falling. Medical treatments for falls are painful, costly and lead
                                        to potentially more challenges for the patient and their families. 25% of older
                                        adults fall every year, and 20% of these falls result in serious injuries, but
                                        new technology research can catch some falls before they happen.</p>
                                    <p>Two of the newest UC Merced faculty in computer science are teaming up
                                        with&nbsp;<a

                                        including on zoom, to help prevent falls. Computer Science professors&nbsp;<a

                                            href="http://www.pans-lab.com/">Shijia Pan</a>&nbsp;are relying on the
                                        testbed of the workout and balance training classes to improve the lives of
                                        participants and older adults everywhere. Pan&rsquo;s lab explores new ways to
                                        achieve accurate monitoring without hampering privacy and movements by making
                                        Internet of Things (IoT) sensing systems smarter. &ldquo;Smart home applications
                                        enhance people&rsquo;s quality of life&rdquo; Pan said.</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>The data collected will provide personalized recommendations based on how high
                                        the older adult lifts their foot, the length of their step, the rhythm of their
                                        gait, strength, and other metrics. Using fine-scale information from wristbands
                                        and floor tiles instrumented with sensors they will interpret normal walking,
                                        and pre-fall walking. They plan to expand this work in non-controlled
                                        environments, using similar comfortable sensors. Complex math and communication
                                        among all sensors underlie the interpretations of data in near-real time,
                                        eventually alerting caretakers to increased risk of falls. With JoAnn Seibles of
                                        the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UC Davis, the team is using
                                        an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together computer science, social
                                        epidemiology and quantitative psychology. Pan also won best paper for her work
                                        at prestigious conferences, including work on the footstep-induced floor
                                        vibrations.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, Networking is not just awkward introductions; it is a critical key to
                                        accessing careers and opportunities through near-peers. CITRIS awarded another
                                        proposal to improve student access to networks through a series of mentoring
                                        events and direct connections across Berkeley, Davis and Merced graduate and
                                        undergraduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering and
                                        Mathematics&mdash;the STEM fields.</p>
                                    <p>Professor Erin Hestir leads CITRIS UC Merced&rsquo;s Women in Technology
                                        programming, including the training program for STEM students to access tech
                                        careers called&nbsp;<a

                                        colleagues Sarah McCullough (UC Davis Feminist Research Institute) and Anita
                                        Balaraman (Fung Institute of Engineering Leadership and Haas School of Business
                                        at UC Berkeley), Hestir will study and facilitate inter-campus networking and
                                        provide training on what it takes to be a good mentor and mentee. Hestir
                                        reflected the personal motivation of the work: &ldquo;I would not be where I am
                                        today if not for the mentors in my life. I want to afford our students the same
                                        opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

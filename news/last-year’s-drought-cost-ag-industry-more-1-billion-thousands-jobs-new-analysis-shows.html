                                <p>The 2021 drought directly cost the California agriculture sector about $1.1 billion
                                    and nearly 8,750 full- and part-time jobs, according to estimates in a new analysis
                                    led by UC Merced researchers.</p>
                                <p>Once the effects on other economic sectors are considered, total impacts are
                                    estimated at $1.7 billion and 14,634 full- and part-time jobs lost.</p>
                                <p><a href="http://drought.ucmerced.edu">The Economic Impacts of the 2021 Drought on
                                        California Agriculture Preliminary Report,</a> released today, analyzes the
                                    impacts of last year’s drought in the Central Valley, the Russian River Basin and
                                    northern intermountain valley areas. The researchers developed these preliminary
                                    estimates of economic impacts using surveys, reviews of hydrological information and
                                    remote sensing data gathered from those areas and comparing them to average
                                    conditions, as well as to the 2012-2016 drought.</p>
                                <p>The report identifies at least additional 395,000 acres of idled land — roughly
                                    385,000 acres in the Central Valley alone with respect to pre-drought conditions due
                                    to drought-related water cutbacks.</p>
                                <p>Several regions in the Sacramento valley, the west side of the San Joaquin Valley,
                                    Tulare County and Kern County were the most affected. Other drought-affected areas
                                    include the Russian River Basin and intermountain agricultural areas in Siskiyou,
                                    Shasta and Modoc counties. The crops most significantly affected by increased
                                    fallowing include rice in the Sacramento Valley, cotton in the San Joaquin Valley,
                                    and grain and field crops statewide.</p>
                                <p>“In comparison with the 2012-2016 drought, conditions were much worse for the
                                    Sacramento Valley and the Russian River Basin, yet the statewide impacts have not
                                    been as severe as in 2015 — the deepest point in the last drought,” said <a

                                        href="http://wsm.ucmerced.edu/josue-medellin-azuara/">Professor Josué
                                        Medellín-Azuara</a>, lead author of the report. “Should dry conditions persist
                                    throughout 2022, a higher tier of adaptation measures may come into play to reduce
                                    economic impacts on agriculture and communities that host thousands of households
                                    relying on agriculture for a living.”</p>
                                <p>The report also highlights strong commodity prices that have helped mitigate some
                                    economic costs of the 2021 drought. Milk prices rose because of global demand,
                                    raising revenues and offsetting some of the drought-related effects of higher
                                    production costs. The dairy sector also explored alternatives to hay and winter
                                    grains that, in some cases, increased cow milk productivity. The beef cattle sector
                                    also had to adapt to scarce winter pastures and higher forage prices, but the
                                    state’s beef cow herd increased, as did its share of the national cow herd, leading
                                    to potential revenue gains.</p>

                                <p>While Californians are familiar with drought, the 2020-21 water years were the second
                                    driest two years on record. Although precipitation deficits were widespread, drought
                                    conditions were more severe in the Sacramento Valley and the North Coast regions. A
                                    lack
                                    of atmospheric rivers and a below-average snowpack depleted most reservoirs and
                                    aquifers
                                    in 2021, the report states.</p>
                                <p>“This has been a fast-paced drought and it shows how climate change increases the
                                    challenges we face in managing water in California,” said researcher and co-author
                                    <a href="https://www.ppic.org/person/alvar-escriva-bou/"> Alvar Escriva-Bou</a>, an
                                    engineering and policy expert at the <a href="https://www.ppic.org/">Public Policy
                                        Institute of California</a>. “Sadly, we are going to see more and more droughts
                                    like
                                    this, so we need better tools to anticipate and minimize the socio-economic
                                    impacts.”
                                </p>
                                <p>But drought is not only defined by the water supply, the researchers wrote. Warmer
                                    temperatures and already-dry conditions increased crop irrigation demands and
                                    widened
                                    the gap between water supply and irrigation needs.</p>
                                <p>“Warming has impacted seasonal water availability, namely through reducing spring
                                    snowmelt runoff and through increasing atmospheric thirst,” said Professor <a
                                        href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/john-abatzoglou"> John Abatzoglou</a>,
                                    climate expert and co-author in the report. “These factors in concert have
                                    intensified
                                    drought severity and impacts in the state and increased the need for actionable
                                    solutions to cope with drought.”</p>
                                <p>The drought hit during the early implementation of Sustainable Groundwater Management
                                    Act
                                    (SGMA) sustainability plans. The Act is designed to avoid the undesirable
                                    consequences
                                    of unsustainable groundwater use. Groundwater sustainability plans for critically
                                    overdrafted basins were submitted in 2020 and plans in other priority basins are due
                                    early this year. These plans remain in progress throughout the state for these and
                                    other
                                    priority basins. California’s increasingly variable supply of surface water and
                                    overdrafted groundwater aquifers present serious challenges for meeting societal
                                    needs,
                                    the report points out.</p>
                                <p>“It is no surprise that California leans more heavily on groundwater to help meet its
                                    water supply needs during drought. SGMA is now well underway, and it is shaping how
                                    we
                                    respond to drought, especially in the Valley. Despite the very real economic impact,
                                    this report also indicates an enormous capacity for innovation and adaptation in the
                                    agricultural industry, not limited to augmenting cattle feed with almond hulls
                                    —typically a byproduct — and also direct investments in aquifer recharge techniques
                                    and
                                    technologies,” said report co-author <a

                                    “These innovations, coupled with better information about water application and use,
                                    will ultimately help us manage scarce water supplies more effectively.”</p>

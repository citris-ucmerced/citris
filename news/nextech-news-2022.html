                                    <p>University of California, Merced-- Second-year Mechanical Engineering student
                                        Lina B-Hernandez had a different experience than many young people growing up in
                                        the San Joaquin Valley. “As a middle school student, I learned to do hands-on
                                        activities with robotics and coding. This opened my eyes to the many
                                        opportunities that I would have in the future, and as a NexTech educator I hope
                                        to bring that same feeling to the middle school students.” Despite being two
                                        hours drive from Silicon Valley, the birthplace of tech, Lina’s school in Madera
                                        offering robotics is an exception rather than the rule. </p>

                                    </div>

                                    <p>CITRIS—the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society
                                        and the Banatao Institute at UC Merced—started the program in 2015 and has
                                        delivered high-quality equipment and experiences with technology via the NexTech
                                        Robotics program. The program was started by an outstanding alumna Alexus Garcia
                                        who built it from scratch based on the robot kits, working with schools to
                                        fulfill their afterschool needs and student interests. </p>

                                    <p>The curriculum covers major topics of coding, design, and the interaction between
                                        hardware and software to perform a specific task, otherwise known as an embedded
                                        system. NexTech is continually adapting and introducing new curriculum to cover
                                        topics of 3-D visualization and design and the versatile computer language,
                                        Python. </p>

                                    <p>Peter Sou is spending his last year at UC Merced building new units of curriculum
                                        on Python before joining the ag-tech workforce. "It's a very versatile and
                                        beginner-friendly language that can open up different avenues including web
                                        development, AI, and data science." Typically, the robots are programmed in a
                                        block or Scratch style of coding—a drag and drop format—but Python affords the
                                        students to see the next steps ahead of them. Previous educators have built
                                        units on drones, remote sensing, and HTML. </p>

                                    <p>UC Merced students serve as mentors and illustrate a pathway to success in
                                        higher education. That’s what matters most to Mechanical Engineering student
                                        Paul Conanan who said that “Being a NexTech Educator allows me to give back to
                                        my community and hopefully inspire a new generation of students.” </p>

                                        time in 2021. </p>

                                    <p>CITRIS UC Merced Director Joshua Viers said, “Since its inception, NexTech has
                                        embodied what is best about UC Merced and its students and our community.
                                        NexTech provides not only opportunities for local middle schoolers to learn
                                        about cool new tech and how to build and program robots – useful skills in our
                                        digital age – but also provides opportunities for UC Merced students to learn
                                        something about themselves as they share their knowledge and experiences with
                                        the soon-to-be next generation of tech leaders from the San Joaquin Valley.”

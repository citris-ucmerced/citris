                                <section>
                                    <p>The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the
                                        Banatao Institute (CITRIS) announce the recipients of the 2021 CITRIS Seed
                                        Awards. Competitive teams from the <a
                                            href="https://citris-uc.org/about/campuses/">University of California
                                            campuses</a> at Berkeley, Davis, Davis Health, Merced and Santa Cruz
                                        submitted 47 proposals for innovative, early-stage projects that emphasize
                                        collaboration across two or more institutions. This year, thanks in part to
                                        external philanthropic support, 13 teams were selected to each receive a
                                        one-time award of up to $60,000 for interdisciplinary work. These projects are
                                        designed to show results within a year, but many promise far-reaching influence
                                        on the future of their fields.</p>



                                    <p>“We are proud to support these innovative multidisciplinary proposals that
                                        demonstrate not only the bold ideas of UC faculty members but the power of
                                        forging partnerships across campuses to advance technology solutions for some of
                                        the most pressing issues of our day,” said CITRIS Director <a
                                            href="https://citris-uc.org/people/person/costas-spanos/">Costas Spanos</a>.
                                    </p>



                                    <p>The selected proposals address grand challenges, including climate resilience,
                                        digital health innovation, next-generation technology policy, and automation and
                                        the workforce. Wildfire mitigation and decision support was a common theme: One
                                        project proposes using a swarm of uncrewed aerial vehicles to detect wildfires
                                        earlier, while others aim to protect civilians with air quality monitoring,
                                        robust building materials and safety training. Other projects will leverage
                                        machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) to offer human-centered
                                        solutions to clean energy, water management and advanced health care issues.</p>



                                    <p>Just as their proposals tackle critical problems in innovative ways, the teams
                                        feature faculty members from diverse fields. The investigators’ backgrounds
                                        range from mechanical and aerospace engineering to architecture, ophthalmology
                                        and management of complex systems. More than half the projects include
                                        pre-tenure faculty, and 85 percent of this year’s lead investigators are new
                                        CITRIS Seed Award recipients.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Since 2008, the <a
                                            href="https://citris-uc.org/labs-programs/seed-funding/citris-core-seed-funding/">CITRIS
                                            Seed Funding</a> program has supported more than 235 projects and over 425
                                        researchers, resulting in extramural funding up to four times the initial
                                        investment within three years of completion. CITRIS Seed Awards facilitate the
                                        scientific groundwork, data collection and prototyping necessary to pursue
                                        larger research or commercialization awards that address major unsolved
                                        challenges.</p>



                                    <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-default" />



                                    <p>The following proposals received 2021 awards:</p>



                                    <p><strong>Air-drag-reducing microstructured surfaces (ARMS) for improved fuel
                                            efficiency</strong><br>Principal Investigators: Grace Gu (Lead PI, UC
                                        Berkeley), Stephen Robinson (UC Davis)</p>



                                    <p>Skin friction drag, i.e., air drag due to friction against surfaces, reduces the
                                        energy efficiency of various technologies, including aircraft, wind turbines and
                                        gas pipelines. These applications contribute up to 3.5 percent of total global
                                        carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing their fuel efficiency by even 1 percent
                                        could save over 180 million gallons of fossil fuel per year.&nbsp; This project
                                        intends to create a synthetic surface inspired by shark skin, a material that
                                        has been proven to reduce friction drag when compared to a smooth surface.
                                        Covering airplane panels, wind turbine blades and gas pipelines with this novel
                                        material could significantly decrease the amount of energy needed to power their
                                        use and have a positive impact on emissions.</p>



                                    <p><strong>Auditing the compliance of California consumer privacy regulations at
                                            scale</strong><br>Principal Investigators: Serge Egelman (Lead PI, UC
                                        Berkeley), Zubair Shafiq (UC Davis)</p>



                                    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides enhanced privacy protections
                                        and rights for California residents. Enacted in 2018, the CCPA allows consumers
                                        to request information about how a business collects, uses and discloses their
                                        personal information, and to withdraw their consent from the sale of personal
                                        data. This project will examine the implementation of these new regulations to
                                        learn how well application developers understand their obligations and create
                                        processes for consumers to exercise their rights. The study will also
                                        investigate the accuracy of companies’ responses to these requests and the
                                        effectiveness of consent mechanisms. The findings of this research can help
                                        legal entities strengthen consumer rights and could generate tools for
                                        developers to ensure their apps meet CCPA standards.</p>



                                    <p><strong>Automated wearable ophthalmic imaging device</strong><br>Principal
                                        Investigators: Parisa Emami Naeini (Lead PI, UC Davis Health), Iman Soltani (UC
                                        Davis)</p>



                                    <p>Vision impairment is one of the most common disabilities worldwide, yet most
                                        cases can be prevented through regular eye exams and advanced ocular imaging.
                                        However, current imaging technologies are expensive and bulky, require skilled
                                        technicians to operate, and cannot accommodate a diverse range of patient needs
                                        and abilities. As a result, many people — such as children and the elderly,
                                        those in remote regions and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds — don’t
                                        have access to vision-saving technology. This project will develop an automated
                                        wearable ophthalmic imaging device, consisting of a virtual reality headset with
                                        fundus imaging and optical coherence tomography systems. Patients will see
                                        entertaining visual stimuli while receiving vital diagnostic care. The
                                        instrument is intended to be operable in any setting, and will increase
                                        equitable access to medical technologies across socioeconomic statuses and
                                        geographic areas.</p>



                                    <p><strong>Clearing the air: Using smart thermostats to improve wildfire resiliency
                                            in Californian homes</strong><br>Principal Investigators: Stefano Schiavon
                                        (Lead PI, UC Berkeley), Mark Modera (UC Davis)</p>



                                    <p>Fine particulate matter is the largest environmental risk factor for human health
                                        and death in California, and wildfires in the western United States are a major
                                        source. Exposure studies have largely focused on outdoor particulate
                                        concentrations, but people tend to shelter indoors during fire events. This
                                        project will develop software that programs smart thermostats to adjust
                                        ventilation system operation based on outdoor particulate concentrations, in
                                        order to ensure indoor air quality. Using this technology, smart thermostats can
                                        reduce air intake in occupied buildings when outdoor air quality is poor and use
                                        air quality forecasts to precondition homes to reduce peak cooling loads. This
                                        project not only decreases the health risks associated with wildfires, but also
                                        sets the groundwork for future efforts to use big data to improve public health
                                        and climate resilience.</p>



                                    <p><strong>Developing resilient materials and sensors for improved building
                                            performance</strong><br>Principal Investigators: Lilian Davila (Lead PI, UC
                                        Merced), Jeanette Cobian-Iñiguez (UC Merced), Scott Moura (UC Berkeley)</p>



                                    <p>Climate change is increasingly affecting communities around the world through
                                        more intense and frequent wildfires, extensive flooding, and other natural
                                        disasters. This project will design, fabricate and test new eco-friendly,
                                        fire-resistant construction materials, as well as low-cost, integrated
                                        environmental sensors to measure their performance. The design process will
                                        inform the future development, testing and implementation of similar building
                                        materials and monitoring devices while also promoting sustainable materials and
                                        reuse of industry waste. If the materials generated by this project prove to be
                                        fire-resistant, thermally insulating and structurally robust, they could
                                        establish a path away from steel, a key construction component that greatly
                                        contributes to carbon dioxide emissions.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p><strong>Electric tractors: Identifying paths to clean energy in farming
                                            operations</strong><br>Principal Investigators: Ricardo Pinto de Castro
                                        (Lead PI, UC Merced), Reza Ehsani (UC Merced), Stavros Vougioukas (UC Davis)</p>



                                    <p>Almost all agricultural vehicles in current use rely on fossil fuels, one of the
                                        main sources of air pollutants. Electrification is a long-term solution to this
                                        problem, but to date, electric tractors have cost more, required more
                                        infrastructure and worked fewer hours per charge than their diesel counterparts.
                                        This project will develop a tool to help farm managers determine when to deploy
                                        the electric and diesel tractors in their fleets. This decision tool relies on
                                        data collected from the farm, such as acreage, crop types, soil and weather
                                        patterns, to compute overall power requirements for the fleet. Optimization
                                        techniques will help characterize an ideal balance between technical
                                        performance, economic costs and air pollution. The resulting information can
                                        help stakeholders in agriculture develop electrification strategies and
                                        ultimately create more sustainable systems.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>While many researchers have thoroughly investigated assistive technologies to
                                        help people with visual impairments navigate and experience their environments
                                        in rich detail, few devices have been adapted beyond research spaces. This
                                        project aims to take assistive aids out of the laboratory and into the world by
                                        creating a tactile phone cover to provide the user with a haptic map of
                                        surrounding obstacles using controllable surface topography. By relying on
                                        touch, rather than sound, this technology allows for people with visual
                                        impairments to be aware of their surroundings while also being able to sense
                                        their environment in richer detail. This technology can help individuals with
                                        visual impairments to move around their surroundings more independently and also
                                        inform further development of haptic assistive devices.</p>

                                    <p>Agriculture is responsible for roughly 70 percent of human water consumption, and
                                        growing populations require the production of more food — and thus the use of
                                        more water. However, due to climatic extremes and unpredictable water supplies,
                                        some regions must enhance crop yields with a more strategic, data-informed
                                        approach to water usage. This project will develop high-resolution spatial and
                                        temporal irrigation models for a global-scale water information system to
                                        replace commonly used but outdated global irrigation maps. This new system
                                        relies on satellite remote sensing and artificial intelligence, as well as
                                        global models of irrigation water needs, water availability and actual
                                        irrigation schemes. Powered by deep learning algorithms, the resulting models
                                        can inform policymakers, academic researchers and nongovernmental organizations
                                        to guide decisions on water management, investment and policy.</p>

                                    <p>Low-mobility individuals are disproportionately affected by pressure ulcers and
                                        injuries, wounds that develop in localized areas of tissue and can take years to
                                        heal. This open-source project based on the Internet of Things (IoT) will
                                        integrate vital sign sensors and surfaces such as mattresses or wheelchairs into
                                        a patient monitoring framework. The resulting system is designed to operate
                                        autonomously and continuously, with real-time data collection, storage and
                                        analysis. Given the system’s ability to detect conditions early, its immediate
                                        visual feedback and its integration of different sensors based on a patient’s

                                    <p>Health care provisioning and basic services in the Global South rely heavily on
                                        affordable and reliable electricity, and a lack of data on power quality and
                                        reliability hinders efforts to address the temperature-dependent supply chain,
                                        or cold chain, of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. By using outlet-level power

                                    <p>While California has faced numerous hazardous wildfires in recent years, fires at
                                        the wildland-urban interface (WUI) are particularly dangerous, as they burn
                                        synthetic compounds that can make their smoke more toxic than wildland blazes.
                                        Currently, WUI fires can be only partially mitigated by human responders and the
                                        resulting smoke plumes are poorly understood while they travel across long
                                        distances. To provide support in the short term, this project will build and
                                        deploy a swarm of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and use them to measure a
                                        range of toxic gases and aerosols in WUI plumes during active fire events. In
                                        the long-term, this research aims to develop UAV swarms that can autonomously
                                        assess fire risks, predict the transfer of outdoor pollutants into indoor
                                        environments, and better characterize the health effects of toxic wildfire
                                        plumes.</p>

                                    <p>Given the devastating breadth of wildfires across 12 states in 2020, and the
                                        increasing prevalence of fires in locations with historically lower danger, more
                                        people are being exposed to fires at the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Many
                                        people in these locations are unaware of the dangers of wildfires and unprepared
                                        to evacuate their homes. This project plans to develop a platform for public
                                        fire training through immersive virtual environments for greater accessibility
                                        and evacuation decision-making under time pressure. The platform will help
                                        determine which sensory metrics best predict performance for these types of
                                        decisions and accurately represent real-time cognition. This technology will

                                        changes in their functional ability and physiological capacity has become more
                                        common in recent years, no wearable devices are yet commercially available to
                                        measure step symmetry. Step symmetry is an important early indicator of health
                                        conditions that may leave older adults unable to live independently. To
                                        encourage proactive care for these problems, this project will combine a

                                        signals to determine critical changes in a patient’s gait. Observing these

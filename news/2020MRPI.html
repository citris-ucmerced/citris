                                <p>Two new projects designed and led by UC Merced researchers will address challenges
                                    facing many Californians — wildfire recovery and agricultural labor — but will also
                                    have global reach.</p>
                                <p>Both are funded through the University of California’s prestigious <a
                                        href="https://www.ucop.edu/research-initiatives/programs/mrpi/"> Multicampus
                                        Research Programs and Initiatives </a> (MRPI) Awards. In addition to these two
                                    projects, six UC Merced faculty members are co-primary investigators on projects led
                                    by other UC campuses and about a dozen more UC Merced faculty members are
                                    participating in the eight MRPI-supported projects.</p>
                                <p>Awarded every two years, the highly competitive MRPI program seeks to leverage the
                                    world-renowned research capabilities of the UC system to develop real-world
                                    solutions to significant problems facing the state and the world.</p>
                                <p>This year’s competition garnered 94 proposals that spanned the breadth of UC’s
                                    expertise, from computer science and particle physics to anthropology and human
                                    rights. Fifteen projects — totaling $19 million — were selected based on their
                                    compelling approaches to advancing research areas that are important to UC and the
                                    state.</p>
                                <p>“The MRPI competition funds discoveries that improve the lives of Californians and
                                    draws world-class student, faculty and staff talent to the University,” said UC
                                    President Michael V. Drake, M.D. “UC programs like this help keep California at the
                                    forefront of breakthrough research and technological innovation.”</p>

                                    Resources (ANR).</p>
                                <p>“I’ve been thinking a lot about the future of agricultural labor and smart farming
                                    technology,” Harmon said. “California is an agriculturally diverse and productive
                                    state, and yet its food system is vulnerable to climate change, regulatory change,
                                    water availability and unexpected disturbances. Agricultural workforce shortages are
                                    also negatively affecting our food system.”</p>
                                <p>By partnering with farmers, workers, environmentalists and agriculturalists, LACA
                                    aims to create a new model for agricultural technology that is farmer- and
                                    worker-friendly while enhancing productivity and environmental sustainability.</p>
                                <p>“It won’t take away jobs, but it will require new skill sets, such as data analysis
                                    and working alongside automation, which will open up new and equitable career
                                    paths,” Harmon explained. “The future of California agriculture is less about
                                    back-breaking labor and more about enhancing productivity and quality, while
                                    creating a more work-friendly, resilient and sustainable agri-food system.”</p>

                                    examining the future of farm work, barriers to technology adoption and the
                                    California farm-labor markets; and Underlying and Emerging Issues, strategically
                                    addressing key policy and legal issues, agroeconomic, and social issues that LACA

                                    and recovery efforts in California communities that are doubly vulnerable to
                                    catastrophic wildfires.</p>
                                <p>The increasingly large and intense wildfires California deals with each year put
                                    millions
                                    of residents at risk for significant damages, economic losses and deaths. While
                                    scientists can better identify wildfire risks across the state, fire professionals
                                    and
                                    planners do not know if planning and recovery efforts are reaching Californians who
                                    are
                                    both socio-economically disadvantaged and live or work in high-risk areas.</p>
                                <p>“Many studies look at disaster-preparedness in urban areas, but few of them examine
                                    disadvantaged communities in the outskirts of urban areas and rural areas, where
                                    there’s
                                    a substantial reliance on agriculture,” Kolden said. “But it’s important to address
                                    these communities because disadvantaged groups are historically underrepresented
                                    during
                                    planning, and wildfire mitigation and resilience relies on the entire community’s
                                    participation.”</p>
                                <p>Kolden and colleagues at UCLA and Berkeley will work with organizations representing
                                    vulnerable communities and tribal groups to develop a spatial database of doubly
                                    vulnerable communities; a mixed-methods assessment of pre-fire planning and
                                    post-fire
                                    recovery; and develop an interactive, Web-based toolkit for communities, agencies
                                    and
                                    nonprofits to support and empower doubly vulnerable populations.</p>
                                <p>“I am incredibly excited to see the research that will result from these awards. The

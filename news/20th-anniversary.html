                                                to benefit society. The University of California research center has
                                                forged public and private partnerships to shape the future of
                                                tech.</strong></em></p>



                                    <p><strong>December 3, 2020 (Berkeley, California) </strong>–This month marks 20
                                        years since the founding of the Center for Information Technology Research in
                                        the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute. Since 2000, CITRIS
                                        and its community of University of California researchers and industry partners
                                        have developed and delivered information technology solutions to address
                                        society’s most pressing challenges.</p>



                                    <p>“CITRIS, at its core, is a collective effort focused on the pursuit of
                                        discovery—scientific and technical discovery, but with a view of the real-world
                                        effects of these technologies on our daily lives,” said <a

                                        Sciences at UC Berkeley.</p>



                                    <p>On December 4, 2000, Governor Gray Davis announced the launch of four visionary
                                        Institutes for Science and Innovation (ISIs), including CITRIS. The multicampus
                                        institutes share a vital mission: to improve the lives of Californians by
                                        tackling large-scale societal problems through interdisciplinary research and
                                        new market applications.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Since its founding, CITRIS has been headquartered at UC Berkeley with partner
                                        campuses at Davis (including Davis Health), Merced, and Santa Cruz. Together
                                        faculty, postdocs, students, clinicians, and research staff have been working to
                                        anticipate and meet society’s technological needs. In 2016, the Banatao
                                        Institute was added to CITRIS’s name across all four campuses, in recognition of
                                        foundational donors Dado and Maria Banatao.</p>



                                    <p>“From its founding, CITRIS’s mission has been to develop and apply information
                                        technology to create innovative solutions to some of today’s greatest
                                        challenges, be they natural, economic, or societal,” said <a

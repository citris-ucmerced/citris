                                <section>
                                    <p>A team of UC Merced engineering students brought hands-on lessons on drones and
                                        robotics to hundreds of children and families at the recent Tri-Valley
                                        Innovation Fair.</p>
                                    <p>“Drones and robots are a gateway, a spark for young people to explore STEM,” said
                                        Leigh Bernacchi, program director of the Center for Information Technology
                                        Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute at UC
                                        Merced, who led the students in the all-day demonstrations at the March 19 fair.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“With UC Merced engineers teaching and mentoring, students see themselves in
                                        higher education,” she said. “Our new FLY CITRIS program shows that anyone can
                                        program a drone and that technology is fun and creative.”</p>
                                    <p>“I believe a positive hands-on experience can prompt curiosity and excitement in
                                        a student,” said alumna Fatima Gamiño (’20) of Firebaugh, a CITRIS aviation
                                        junior specialist who provided lessons at the innovation fair.</p>
                                    <p>With UC Merced’s Mobile Maker Lab as headquarters, the CITRIS team taught young
                                        people to write simple programs in introductory Python to make drones fly a
                                        pattern — a new curriculum unit developed by Gamiño and Peter Sou (’22) who will
                                        graduate in May with a computer science and engineering degree. At a second
                                        station the young people, from 1-25 years of age, maneuvered driving robots
                                        adorned with UC Merced pennants through a short course. The robots are routinely
                                        used to inspire middle schoolers in Merced about robotics and coding.</p>

                                            to
                                            fly a pattern at the Tri Valley Innovation Fair.</i>
                                    </div>

                                    <p>“The field of drones sparked my interest when I realized that I could combine
                                        innovative
                                        technology with my passion for environmental science,” Gamiño said. “With the
                                        help of
                                        drones, I get to participate in a novel way to capture data and apply it to
                                        local
                                        issues."</p>
                                    <p>Lina B-Hernandez (’24), a mechanical engineering student from Madera, said
                                        teaching
                                        robotics to young people “has given me the opportunity to get out of my comfort
                                        zone and
                                        I have been able to reach new lengths to my own learning.”</p>
                                    <p>“During the event, I got to interact with a younger audience, and I was able to
                                        see their
                                        excitement in learning about robots and coding. Since the pandemic, few students
                                        have
                                        been able to get hands-on experiences and this event helped with their
                                        transition back
                                        to hands-on learning,” she said.</p>
                                    <p>Fellow mechanical engineering student Paul Conanan (’22), from the Bay Area, said
                                        he
                                        enjoys teaching as a way to “give back to my community.”</p>
                                    <p>“What made this event special was the different kids that came and took time off
                                        their
                                        day to learn about robotics and drones,” he said of the Saturday event that
                                        filled five
                                        buildings with science displays for families and children.</p>
                                    <p>“Adding on how COVID drastically affected a student's way of social interaction,
                                        this was
                                        an amazing opportunity for them to expand and learn more and have the chance to
                                        have
                                        some hands-on and in-person learning."</p>
                                    <p>The fourth annual Innovation Fair, held at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in
                                        Pleasanton,
                                        is part of an ongoing effort to raise funds and awareness for the planned Quest
                                        Science
                                        Center. Quest CEO Monya Lane serves as vice chair on the board of the UC Merced
                                        Foundation, and Quest board member Jose Hernandez is a University of California
                                        regent.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Nearly 3,000 students and families registered to attend the fair in advance.</p>
                                    <p>The Mobile Maker Lab — Mobi — was supported by the UC Merced Foundation Board of
                                        Trustees, Joseph Gallo Farms and HP to help faculty and students bring science
                                        lessons
                                        to area schools and community events. Faculty have begun programming school
                                        visits with
                                        Mobi, with planned lessons on robotics and marine biology.</p>
                                    <p>Those interested in having faculty and students bring Mobi to their schools can

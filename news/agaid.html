                                <p>Artificial Intelligence, better known as AI, is changing how decisions are made. </p>
                                <p>AI is an approach to harnessing the power of massive data and computational
                                    algorithms to “learn” about complex systems and their behavior – and it is the basis
                                    of digital transformation across industries. In the new $20M institute funded by
                                    USDA, AI will digitally transform how agriculture works as a complex system. </p>

                                    Institutes funded in 2020. The investment forms a collaboration across the Western

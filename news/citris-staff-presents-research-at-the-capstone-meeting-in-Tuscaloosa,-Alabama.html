            UC Merced PhD student and member of the Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Lab, Brittany Lopez Barreto presented her 2019 National Water Center Summer Institute research findings at the capstone meeting in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. National Weather Service and National Water Center leadership and staff and the CUHASI academic community were in attendance.

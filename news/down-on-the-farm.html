                                        Retired Madera farmer and formidable intellect on all things agriculture and
                                        natural resources, Tom Willey began his podcast “<a

                                        ominous note: “Welcome to the merry month of May show and it would have been
                                        merrier indeed if we had had a much wetter winter or spring. The world is
                                        heating up around us.”
                                    <p>
                                        Willey sat down to talk California’s drought <a
                                            href=http://vicelab.ucmerced.edu/people/#josh-viers>with University of

                                            Merced Professor and Watershed Scientist, Joshua Viers,</a>on May 7, 2021.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The two talked water management approaches, from Sustainable Groundwater
                                        Management Act’s limitations on groundwater use to planting orchards with denser
                                        trees to increase shade and decrease water. They also spoke about energy
                                        production and agriculture, such as the use of agrovoltaics, where solar panels
                                        in the fields of crops, and reducing water loss by covering canals with solar
                                        panels. “Instead of looking for a silver bullet, we need some silver buckshot,
                                        which is to say we’ve got to do a lot of little things right, and taken
                                        together, we may just solve some of these problems,” said Viers.
                                    </p>

                                        <i>There’s no such thing as a normal water year</i>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With esteemed colleague and faculty at Utah State University, Sarah Null, Viers
                                        had conducted a study that explains California’s annual precipitation is
                                        changing at a pace that makes it harder to plan.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Just looking at an average really doesn't get at the heart of our challenges as
                                        that suggests that there's some normality in our water years, and we know that
                                        that's far from the truth,” said Viers. “In fact, the Department of Water
                                        Resources doesn't even have a normal water year by definition.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “We already have reservoirs built about everywhere that you can imagine,”
                                        remarked Willey.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “What we projected ten years ago as coming to bear is more of a bi-modal
                                        distribution.” Viers elaborated, “Things are getting pushed to the extreme. The
                                        analysis showed that for the dry and critically dry years, we expect to increase
                                        three-fold for the San Joaquin.”

                                        and what we refer to as the food energy water nexus ... our Chancellor has now
                                        committed to building a 40 acre experimental smart farm.”

                                        “Our intent is to bring not just research, but to bring our students out there
                                        and to bring the community out there so that it can be a demonstration space for

                                        also bring in humanists and labor advocates and people in Extension that really
                                        know how humans can and will remain in the loop for food production,” Viers
                                        said. “It addresses issues of upskilling the agricultural workforce.”

                                        Willey ushered concerns: “Agriculture has been pretty exploitative of farmers
                                        and farm laborers for about 10,000 years. And whether we can turn the tables on
                                        that or not is a very serious and necessary issue. But since we haven't
                                        accomplished that in 10,000 years, it's a big ask to say that we're going to
                                        change that equation.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Finally, they discussed the future of the San Joaquin Valley. “Assume that we’re
                                        going to have a civilization here a hundred years from now, what’s it going to
                                        look like?” asked Willey. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “I think everyone has a role in helping that come to fruition and really trying
                                        to identify the vision for how we want to live here.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Viers continued, “Humans have certainly persisted on this planet for quite a
                                        while now. And there's always been some ingenuity and some adaptation. It is yet
                                        to be determined how technology may play a role in this. I'd like to think that
                                        if constructed well and used appropriately, it can certainly be a part of that
                                        equation, but at the end of the day, we're all human, and we need to keep humans
                                        in the loop.”

                                        “Yes, indeed. We're very adaptable species,” said Willey. “And the more
                                        cooperative we become, probably will give us the greater chances of survival
                                        into the future.”

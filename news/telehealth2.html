                      Researchers at the Center for Information Technology
                      Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the
                      Banatao Institute at the University of California have
                      launched a new public-private pilot initiative to bring
                      telehealth services to underserved rural residents in
                      Merced County.

                      Accountability, Coordination and Telehealth in the Valley
                      to Achieve Transformation and Equity (ACTIVATE) is
                      partnering with Livingston Community Health, a clinic that
                      serves mostly Latinx communities with primary and
                      preventative health care services regardless of their
                      ability to pay. UC Merced’s

                      (HSRI), the UC’s CITRIS network, tech distributors,
                      community-based organizations and government agencies are
                      also taking part to reach people who are vulnerable to the
                      worst outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic with the
                      technology, skills and connections they need to access and
                      use health services.

                      The San Joaquin Valley has had attention focused on some
                      of its problems, including farmworkers and their increased
                      exposure to COVID-19. But HSRI Director
                      <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/deborah-wiebe">
                        Professor Deborah Wiebe
                      </a>
                      said this collaboration can lead to positive outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “This feels like a way to start turning the tide on issues
                      people have been concerned with for many years, including
                      lack of access to health care, vulnerable populations and
                      health disparities,” she said. “This is one of the bright
                      spots that emerges from the pandemic.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ACTIVATE is co-led by Professor David Lindeman, director
                      of CITRIS Health, and Katherine Kim, professor at the
                      Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing and the School of
                      Medicine at UC Davis.

                    <p>
                      “The patients we’re serving with ACTIVATE are some of the
                      most vulnerable members of society, and not only to
                      COVID-19,” Kim said. “Many are low-income, undocumented,
                      Latinx agricultural workers — these communities have the
                      least access to quality health care services.”

                    <p>
                      California’s rural San Joaquin Valley faces some of the
                      worst health disparities in the state and country. Many
                      residents lack access to basic health care, and service
                      providers in the area have limited reach and coverage. The
                      Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s 2020 County Health
                      Rankings recently ranked Merced County as among the “least
                      healthy” counties in California. Community health workers,
                      public health activists and local leaders are committed to
                      progress on this front, focusing on investing in quality,
                      affordable care that meets residents where they are and
                      improves overall health outcomes in their community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “We still have a long way to go, but things are beginning
                      to line up in very important ways,” Wiebe said.

                      Though details have not been announced, HSRI affiliates
                      will contribute to the partnership through translational
                      research, public outreach and engagement, education and
                      project evaluation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “These are incredibly complex issues that cannot be
                      addressed without all hands on deck,” Wiebe said. “What I
                      love about ACTIVATE is that it’s a public-private project
                      that can make progress in ways no single entity could.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ACTIVATE will first launch at Livingston Community Health
                      in Merced County, and is expected to rapidly expand
                      throughout the state to other community health centers
                      (CHCs) and clinicians who serve vulnerable populations.
                      The goal is not just to provide the technology needed for
                      telehealth and remote health monitoring, but also to
                      ensure that patients are empowered to use it and see
                      greater health outcomes as a result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Program participants will receive health education and
                      training in digital literacy as well as software and
                      hardware (phones, tablets and other remote monitoring
                      equipment) needed to connect with health care providers
                      and monitor chronic health conditions. Building on health
                      education from community health workers and medical
                      assistants, the program emphasizes training of primary
                      care practitioners in CHCs. These critical health care
                      workers are at the front lines of health care in the era
                      of COVID-19. They are embedded in the communities they
                      serve and have the cultural and linguistic skills to break
                      down barriers and help patients access physical and mental
                      health services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “The patients we serve are too often left out by
                      traditional health system models,” Livingston Community
                      Health CEO Leslie Abasta-Cummings said. “They live in
                      rural areas and face financial, cultural, and legal
                      barriers when it comes to accessing health care services.
                      Working with these communities to embed and encourage the
                      use of telehealth technology will empower patients to
                      manage their own health and experience greater health
                      outcomes.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The ACTIVATE team will evaluate the pilot program for
                      achieving goals in technology implementation, outreach,
                      adoption and utilization; successful use of community
                      health workers to reach patients; and improved health
                      behavior and health care outcomes. Working with the Center
                      for Connected Health Policy, ACTIVATE will develop a
                      roadmap for post-pandemic sustainability of health system
                      reforms that incorporate telehealth. Ultimately, ACTIVATE
                      aims to demonstrate that telehealth has the power to serve
                      rural and vulnerable communities, and encourage telehealth
                      solutions as cost-effective means of enhancing
                      community-based health systems.

                      “As we have seen our communities’ strain under the
                      pandemic, it is clear that we need new approaches to
                      solving the most pressing problems, especially in health
                      care,” said

                      that the University of California and Merced campus have
                      to offer in serving the needs of our most vulnerable

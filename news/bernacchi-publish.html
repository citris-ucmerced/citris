                                <p>Bernacchi is the program director of UC Merced’s Center for Information Technology
                                    Research in the Interest of Society (<a href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/"
                                        target=_blank>CITRIS</a>)
                                    and a staff researcher for the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (<a
                                        href="https://snri.ucmerced.edu/people/researchers" target=_blank>SNRI</a>). A
                                    native of the
                                    Sierra Nevada foothills, Bernacchi worked as a naturalist ranger in Sequoia, Denali
                                    and Yosemite national parks before joining the campus in 2015. She is interested in
                                    the intersection of public participation, natural resources and wildlife — all of
                                    which have informed her scientific pursuits and this travel guide.</p>
                                <p>“This book is a love letter to our Valley community members, to get out and
                                    experience the astounding beauty, in every season, of these wild parks,” Bernacchi
                                    said. “Whether hiking solo or with friends, with my grandma or my kid, I researched
                                    this book over several years to create each itinerary and experience. There’s
                                    something for everyone, and it’s so close to UC Merced.”</p>
                                <p> Sequoia and Kings Canyon boasts the highest peak in the lower 48 states — Mount
                                    Whitney — and the Giant Sequoias, including General Sherman, the largest living
                                    being in the world. The geologic wonders carved out by the Kings River range from
                                    granite with massive crystals to metamorphics. Waterfalls and verdant meadows fill
                                    every valley. Bernacchi has spent time in Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon as a ranger,
                                    tourist and a mom.</p>
                                <p>Her book is full of suggested itineraries, hiking guides, cabin recommendations and
                                    more. With limited Wi-Fi and cell phone access, it’s smart to have Bernacchi’s book
                                    on hand when venturing to Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon.</p>

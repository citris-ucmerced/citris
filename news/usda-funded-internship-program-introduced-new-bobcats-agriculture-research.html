                                <p>Shortly before the fall semester kicked off in person, 11 students were wrapping up
                                    their first summer on campus as part of the <a
                                        href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/facts">FACTS summer bridge program</a>.</p>
                                <p>FACTS stands for San Joaquin Valley Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics Tools and
                                    Science. The six-week summer course, funded by the United States Department of
                                    Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture, introduces students
                                    to the world of research in agricultural science and technology.</p>
                                <p>Through the FACTS bridge program, first-year and transfer students get a head start
                                    on research and much more. The internship was led by <a
                                        href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/colleen-naughton">Professor Colleen
                                        Naughton</a> and included visits to local farms and industries, giving students
                                    exposure to real-world applications of the region’s agricultural industry.</p>
                                <p>“The program went very well despite the continued challenges of the COVID-19
                                    pandemic,” Naughton said. “It was great to be back in person for the first time
                                    since Spring 2020. I learned a ton alongside the students. The students exceeded my
                                    expectations for their research and poster presentations at the symposium. They put
                                    in a ton of hard work and woke up early many Fridays and braved the heat to
                                    participate in the practical field days.”</p>
                                <p>Each student had the opportunity to select which professor and areas of focus —
                                    ranging from hydrology to nutrition and food security — to work with to begin their
                                    academic careers. For instance, incoming mechanical engineering student Kyle Chun
                                    worked on drones with faculty mentor <a

                                <p>“FACTS made my summer because I was able to meet a wide variety of people, from my
                                    fellow interns and guest speakers on our Wednesday workshops to people who gave us
                                    tours on our Friday field trips,” said Lauren Hur (computer science and engineering,
                                    class of 2024). “Even as someone who had no prior exposure to the field of
                                    agriculture, I was able to leave this program with new profound knowledge of
                                    ag-tech.”</p>
                                <p>The internship culminated in August with the students presenting their research
                                    posters at a symposium. Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz attended and spoke to the new
                                    Bobcats along with the students’ faculty mentors.

                                <p>The FACTS grant proposal was put together by CITRIS (Center of Information Technology
                                    Research in the Interest of Society) in collaboration with faculty from the School
                                    of Natural Sciences, School of Engineering, Merced County Public Health Department
                                    and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources. The proposal was one of 26 grants selected
                                    for funding by the USDA.

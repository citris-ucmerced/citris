                      Recently, the Center for Information Technology Research
                      in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao
                      Institute hosted University of California, Merced
                      professor, recipient of a F3 Challenge Grant, and CITRIS
                      Seed Fund Ricardo de Castro. On October 12, 2022, he
                      discussed his newest endeavor: “Electric Propulsion in
                      Agriculture Vehicles: Opportunities and Challenges.” Dr.
                      de Castro dove into the pressing issue of the emission
                      rates of diesel tractors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As an undergraduate studying mechanical engineering, I
                      have studied the emission rates and the overall
                      inefficiencies within the diesel cycle. Seeing what I
                      study being applied to real world scenarios was not only
                      motivating but made me question personal career choices.
                      CITRIS is a fully functioning research unit with the
                      University of California, Merced with heavy student driven
                      initiatives. CITRIS here at UC Merced addresses
                      California’s most pressing societal and environmental
                      problems by leveraging cutting-edge technologies,
                      developing novel research, and conducting inspiring
                      outreach. These research exchange events gave Dr. de
                      Castro a platform to show all the challenging work he has
                      done on advancing electric propulsion within agriculture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In his talk, Dr. de Castro discusses how an electric
                      powertrain has efficiencies greater than 90% while its
                      diesel counterpart sits anywhere from 35-45% efficient. As
                      explained by the automobile company,
                      <a
                        href="https://www.kia.com/id/discover-kia/ask/what-is-a-powertrain.html#:~:text=A%20powertrain%20is%20an%20assembly%20of%20every%20component%20that%20pushes,driveshaft%2C%20axles%2C%20and%20differential."
                        >Kia</a
                      >, a powertrain is “an assembly of every component that
                      pushes your vehicle forward." Most inefficiency stems from
                      friction and the heat generated during operations.
                      Additionally, Electric powertrains also provide a quieter
                      operation environment while the diesel powertrains are
                      loud enough that the CDC says, “if an individual exposed
                      to such an environment for even five minutes. The said
                      individual is susceptible to permanent hearing damage and
                      loss.” Dr. de Castro elaborated on maintenance between the
                      two powertrains and the electric option comes out on top
                      as the cheaper alternative. With all these overwhelming
                      stats it poses the question; why are not all tractors
                      electric already? Dr. de Castro explains that there are a
                      few major limitations with electric.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Diesel powertrains are overall more efficient when it
                      comes to harder and longer days whereas electric is only
                      most viable in light work scenarios. This is in part to
                      the size of battery, the cost of recharging, and the cost
                      of a battery replacement. There is a limit of how big the
                      battery can be because if it is too large the tractor
                      could have a gross weight large enough that damages the
                      soil because of the pressure induced by the tractor. As it
                      stands currently, farms also do not have the
                      infrastructure to support the charging of batteries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, Dr. de Castro gave multiple options and scenarios
                      to combat the challenges of electric farm vehicles.
                      Cutting the standard operation time down from eight hours
                      to just four hours a day would make electric more viable –
                      primarily since the load of a four-hour day is much less
                      than that of an eight-hour day. Farmers are already
                      looking for ways to reduce operation times to help lower
                      fuel costs. Dr. de Castro adds that the cost to recharge
                      these batteries is getting cheaper. Soon the price
                      difference between gas and electricity will be cost
                      effective enough to start utilizing electric tractors. In
                      my opinion, the most important development is that only
                      0.5% of the crop area here in California needs to be
                      covered in solar panels to produce enough power to support
                      all the tractors here in California.

                      Dr. Castro acknowledges that these new concepts and
                      technology are challenging to implement. However, he has
                      been developing comparison matrixes with simulations that
                      will help the everyday farmer pick the right tractor
                      fleet. Whether that is diesel, electric or even a hybrid.

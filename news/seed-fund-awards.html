        UC Merced professors are leading or participating in four technology projects designed to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis. 
        The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute awarded 
        seed grants to 25 interdisciplinary, multi-campus teams to address the pandemic. More than 95 proposals were reviewed, 
        including rapid-cycle ventilators; next-generation face masks; new algorithms for contact tracing and advance prediction; 
        and a portable, point-of-care rapid-testing device the size of a credit card.

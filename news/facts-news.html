                                <p>The FACTS Bridge Program is a new internship designed to immerse students in
                                    agricultural science and research. It stands for San Joaquin Valley Food and
                                    Agriculture Cyberinformatics Tools and Science (FACTS). The six-week summer course,
                                    funded by the United States Department of Agriculture and National Institute of Food
                                    and Agriculture, introduces students to the world of research in agricultural
                                    science and technology.</p>
                                <p>Led by <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/colleen-naughton">Professor Colleen
                                        Naughton</a>, the internship’s goal is to give undergraduate students
                                    experiential learning opportunities in food, tech and agriculture. Students will
                                    visit local farms and industries, building practical experience and understanding of
                                    the region’s agricultural context for their research and future careers. These
                                    hands-on educational experiences will help lead to a well-prepared and modern
                                    workforce that can fill expected gaps in the country’s food, agriculture and related
                                    industries.</p>
                                <p>“Our ultimate goal is to train a diverse and competitive agricultural workforce that
                                    will increase agricultural productivity and food security for those who need it
                                    most,” Naughton said. Naughton brings her experience from prior work with the Peace
                                    Corps in Mali and current research as a member of the Department of Civil and
                                    Environmental Engineering.</p>
                                <p>To meet the needs of new students, training goes beyond research and academics. The
                                    bridge program provides crucial training in life skills such as budgeting, studying
                                    and stress management needed for success at the university. Students will have the
                                    opportunity to select which professor and areas of focus — ranging from hydrology to
                                    nutrition and food security — to work with to begin their academic careers. A

                                <p>Funding for the FACTS program comes from the United States Department of Agriculture
                                    (USDA). The proposal was put together by CITRIS (Center of Information Technology
                                    Research in the Interest of Society) in collaboration with faculty from School of
                                    Natural Sciences, School of Engineering and Public Health as well as UC Agriculture
                                    and Natural Resources. The proposal was one of 26 grants <a

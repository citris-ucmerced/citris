        CITRIS UC Merced congratulates Valerie Moss, Class of 2020! 
        During her term at UC Merced, Moss has served as a tour guide, 
        ASUCM judge, and intern with the Office of Student Life. With CITRIS, 
        Moss led the transition to tech-based team coordination, helping 
        everyone adopt new technologies and practices; was instrumental in 
        launching several programs including the inaugural Tech for Social Good 
        program; and conducted social science research on ag-food-tech, women-in-tech 
        and diversity in STEM fields. She brought a critical perspective as a student 
        from the San Joaquin Valley to improving our community with technology programs. 
        Moss graduates with a double major in Cognitive Science and Psychology. She 
        plans to attend graduate school to inform educational policy.

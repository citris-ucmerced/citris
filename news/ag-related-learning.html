                      Students at UC Merced and those who might someday become
                      Bobcats are the focus of FARMERS,

                      FARMERS stands for Facilitating Agriculture-Related
                      Mentoring for Emerging Research Scholars, and the goal is
                      to train 15 undergraduate and 10 graduate students a year
                      over the next four years to conduct in-depth research into
                      agriculture-related subjects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Agriculture as a subject has many layers. It’s not all
                      about being a farmer,” Ortiz said. “There are many
                      opportunities for other kinds of research, including
                      economics, engineering, math, sustainability and more.
                      There will be opportunities that students might not
                      otherwise have explored.”
                    </p>

                      For example, though Ortiz is a physiologist with the

                      The USDA’s Education Collaborative program for

                      especially relevant in the San Joaquin Valley, of course,
                      because not only is this one of the nation’s most
                      disadvantaged regions, it’s also one of the most diverse
                      areas of California, and one of the most agriculturally
                      rich.

                      Besides professional development and research training,
                      FARMERS offers students opportunities for internships,
                      networking and outreach to younger students by helping
                      develop curriculum that will prepare children for college
                      and studies in the science, technology, engineering and
                      math (STEM) fields.

                    <p>
                      “We’re also expanding the number and type of research
                      training opportunities to the diverse population of
                      students supported by UC Merced and our partner HSIs, CSU
                      Stanislaus and UC Santa Cruz and others,” Ortiz said.

                      Melisa Quintana, an Earth systems sciences major who
                      expects to graduate in the spring, is a FARMERS
                      participant. She’s interested in soil health in
                      agroecological systems, nutrient cycling in natural
                      ecosystems, conservation and regeneration of biodiversity,
                      land defense, food sovereignty, social justice and climate
                      resiliency. She is researching how soil health amendments,
                      specifically the addition of biochar and compost, can
                      improve soil quality and increase carbon sequestration in
                      conventional systems and how soil health practices reduce
                      greenhouse gas emissions at dairy farms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Though she did a little bit of experimentation in grade
                      school science classes, once she got to college, her
                      interest grew, and she joined FARMERS, working with
                      <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/rebecca-ryals">
                        Professor Rebecca Ryals</a
                      >, an affiliated faculty member.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I was amazed that you could research topics like the
                      spatial distribution of species over time, changes in
                      species abundance and diversity, soil health practices,
                      integrating sustainable agriculture practices and more,”
                      she said. “After this exposure to different types of
                      research and researchers, I was hooked.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a first-generation Guatemalan American, Quintana said
                      the research she has learned about brought her to some
                      surprising conclusions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I hadn’t known that most of the soil health amendment
                      practices we're integrating to reduce greenhouse gas
                      emissions and increase carbon sequestration stem from
                      Indigenous knowledge and peasant farming practices,” she
                      said. “It was even more surprising when I was talking to
                      my mother, a Guatemalan Campesina, about my work and she
                      mentioned that she has implemented the farming methods I'm
                      learning about on our family's land growing up. I didn't
                      realize how connected my family and I are to the land.”

                      FARMERS is not only for Hispanic students, even though it
                      is part of the HSI program. Over the seven years it has
                      been funded, FARMERS has helped more than 50 students go
                      on to graduate programs and ag-related careers. All
                      FARMERS students have graduated, and Ortiz said he plans
                      that the next group of participants will maintain that
                      perfect record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The students will work on peer-reviewed publications,
                      attend conferences and meetings and be able to join a
                      summer ag institute next year. They will also have
                      opportunities to meet and discuss career opportunities
                      with USDA representatives at meetings and on campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It will be good for students to learn more about the
                      USDA, the way the agency interacts with society and the
                      kinds of career possibilities it offers,” Ortiz said.

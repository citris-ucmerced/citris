TO ADD NEWS:

Make a new HTML file in this folder with the name of the URL of the article you are writing.

Save an image to associate the article in images/news with the same name as the article you are writing.

Copy HTML from an existing news article, and rewrite it to make it specific to the article you are writing.
(this includes locations to images, text, title, etc.)

Add the name of the HTML file (omitting the .html) into items.txt. 

You should see your news article populate itself when loading the news page now.

Order of the article is determined by the order it is written into items.txt.

                                        UC Merced’s strengths in water and agriculture shine at Diversity in Tech
                                        Symposium<br><br>



                                        The 7th Annual Edge in Tech Symposium was held virtually on March 2nd, 2023.
                                        This year’s overarching theme was Smarter Tech for a Resilient Future and
                                        highlighted the experiences of experts using emerging technologies to advance
                                        innovation for more sustainable infrastructure.<br><br>

                                        Watch the highlights of the panel <a href="https://youtu.be/-oRd1P-Yhas">

                                        California is facing a water crisis, with 40-60% of the state's water supply
                                        coming from groundwater. Agriculture accounts for 80% of California’s water
                                        usage, making it imperative for us to find innovative and sustainable ways to
                                        manage our water resources. In this context, technology can play a vital role in
                                        enabling resilience and equity.<br><br>

                                        To showcase some of these challenges, <a href="https://eors.ucmerced.edu/">Erin
                                            Hestir</a> who serves as the Associate Director of <a
                                            href "https://citris.ucmerced.edu/">CITRIS </a> UC Merced and Professor of
                                        Geomatics, moderated a panel discussion on “Water and Agriculture: Resilience
                                        through Better Information.” As Hestir stated, “Water has been the subject of a
                                        lot of attention both in California and across the world. These panelists are
                                        here to share their thoughts with us about the intersection of water and
                                        agriculture and how technology can help us build resilience.” The panel
                                        discussion featured research, non-profit, and technology sector experts:<br><br>

                                        <a href="https://cawaterdata.org/teams/tara-moran/">Dr. Tara Moran</a>,
                                        President and CEO, California Water Data Consortium<br><br>

                                        One example of technology-enabled resilience that could lead to improvements in
                                        water management is using a distributed cloud-based system. This system can
                                        provide data in a wide variety of ways, making it accessible to people from
                                        different backgrounds and with different skill sets.<br><br>

                                        Speaking on this, Moran shared further about how upcoming projects can provide
                                        data to a wide range of users. For example, the California Water Data Consortium
                                        is currently developing an open-source groundwater accounting platform that
                                        integrates data from a variety of different sources, in partnership with the
                                        Environmental Defense Fund, the Department of Water Resources, and the State
                                        Water Resources Control Board. “It essentially links district-level water
                                        budgets directly with parcel-level information so that landowners can plan for
                                        their growing season,” Moran stated. “They can really understand what their
                                        water use is, how it relates to district level goals, and, and then make
                                        planning decisions associated with it.” This cloud-based system helps people see
                                        what wider impacts pumping water may have and what to expect within a larger
                                        system, effectively sharing that data with a diverse group of interests.<br><br>

                                        Panelists noted data in a vacuum can be problematic as it lacks local context.
                                        To ensure that technology is relevant and useful, involving local people in the
                                        policymaking process is essential. For example, Dr. Ajami, during her time at
                                        Stanford University, conducted a study that involved bringing local people to
                                        the table to find out what questions they had in an attempt to address this
                                        issue.<br><br>

                                        Ajami also spoke on the unintended consequences of policies that favor
                                        large-scale farming, essentially overdrafting from water resources. “Groundwater
                                        is an interest,” Ajami told attendees, “like your bank account. You put things
                                        in, you take things out, and we need to put money back in for that savings
                                        account to have a value. Otherwise, it'll be an empty account that you are never
                                        able to draw from.” In one example, a tariff passed in Mexico made electricity
                                        cheap, resulting in the overuse of water and overdrafting. The farm workers in
                                        Baja California are now permanent in the region as a result, but they have no
                                        access to sanitation, education, or water services. Technology can help address
                                        these issues, but it must be designed with the people doing the work in
                                        mind.<br><br>

                                        Connie Bowen emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary learning to address
                                        the complex challenges facing California's water resources. She also spoke about
                                        the need to ensure equity in policy and investment implementation. One way to
                                        achieve this is to encourage different backgrounds and ways of thinking, which
                                        can lead to more innovative and equitable solutions, particularly in the realms
                                        of agriculture and water.<br><br>

                                        “Our agricultural system needs to be able to both provide cheap nutrition and
                                        not do so at the expense of people,” Bowen said, discussing the current
                                        challenges. “Currently, it's not quite doing that, and that is inherently
                                        related to its sustainability and water management elements.” As part of one
                                        solution, she recommended more frequently bringing diverse stakeholders to the
                                        table, where they can be more involved in the issues that impact them.<br><br>

                                        To create a better, diverse, and resilient future for California's water
                                        resources, it is important to involve more people at the table, discuss how
                                        solutions benefit the most variety of people, and have more leaders from
                                        different backgrounds with resources and capital. It is also vital to be aware
                                        of how venture capital works and encourage different backgrounds and ways of
                                        thinking while learning how to deal with disagreements and accept other
                                        cultures.<br><br>

                                        In addition, academic interdisciplinary collaboration can foster an exchange of
                                        knowledge to help tackle the complex challenges facing both California's water
                                        resources and those worldwide. As Dr. Ajami shares at the end of the panel, “The
                                        day that we break some of these existing fragmented systems and have more
                                        interdisciplinary people educated at academic institutions that think about
                                        systems rather than just one box at a time... will be my happy day because I
                                        know that those create exchanges that expand people’s thinking and knowledge.”

                                        </a> from the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in developing
                                        economic analysis and decision support tools for agriculture during droughts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“In every drought in modern times, California has seized opportunities to build
                                        the institutional infrastructure and technical tools to be better prepared for
                                        the next drought,” Medellín-Azuara said. “This research will contribute to close
                                        the shared water-systems-management gaps between California’s prominent and
                                        highly adaptive agriculture and our rural communities to increase climate
                                        resilience.”</p>
                                    <p>Recent California climate extremes have included among the most severe multi-year
                                        droughts on record, highlighting rapidly changing conditions that affect water
                                        supplies for agriculture and the state’s growing population. Incremental water
                                        management and institutional learning at all levels have provided building
                                        blocks to better manage water shortages.</p>
                                    <p>But California is the largest agricultural producer in the nation, generating
                                        more than $50 billion in commodity gross revenue in 2019. Farms underpin the
                                        economy of much of rural California, and the state’s nearly 70,000 farmers and
                                        ranchers produce more than 400 agricultural commodities, according to the
                                        state’s budget report.</p>
                                    <p>Agriculture is threatened by the effects of climate change, including extreme
                                        climate events such as droughts and floods, increases in pests and stressed
                                        ecosystems. The COVID-19 pandemic and emerging drought conditions have disrupted
                                        the food supply chain and created additional challenges for the agricultural
                                        sector. To address these challenges, farmers and ranchers continue to innovate
                                        by adopting agile technology, expanding in local and global markets, and
                                        developing sustainable, climate-smart agricultural practices, the state said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>At the same time, communities connected to agriculture share, to varying extents,
                                        multi-year drought impacts such as water shortages and high temperatures and
                                        their lingering effects, including dry wells, increased fire risk, and degraded
                                        air and water quality.</p>
                                    <p>Some promising avenues point to flexible allocation schemes, managed aquifer
                                        recharge, coordinated operation of surface and water reserves and conveyance,
                                        and institutional reforms such as the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management
                                        Act (SGMA) to preserve the state’s most valuable buffer during droughts.</p>
                                    <p>The researchers will enhance cloud-based collaborative modeling tools to assess
                                        drought impacts and promising adaptations. This will facilitate collaboration
                                        among agencies, academics and other stakeholders to identify drought
                                        vulnerabilities, and provide policy recommendations for ongoing and future
                                        droughts.</p>
                                    <p>“Our goal is to advance state-level drought early-warning systems to give
                                        decision-makers opportunities to mitigate drought impacts,” Abatzoglou said. “It
                                        wasn’t a question of if there will be another multi-year drought like the San
                                        Joaquin Valley endured in 2012-2016, it was a matter of when — and here we are.
                                        Our goals are to use data and decisions to improve drought outcomes for these
                                        events.”</p>
                                    <p>Policy and decision makers will be able to better understand the impacts of
                                        drought — with distributional effects — on disadvantaged communities and the
                                        potential for dry wells.</p>
                                    <p>“By developing tools to understand the consequences of our management actions, we
                                        will be able to inform policy decisions to improve socio-economic outcomes, and
                                        to avoid undesirable consequences on vulnerable communities,” Escriva-Bou said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Besides the economic assessment of drought impacts, the team also plans to
                                        analyze agricultural water costs, produce a series of reports including
                                        forecasts and technical and policy recommendations, and engage with scientific
                                        and stakeholder partners through a variety of channels including workshops.</p>
                                    <p>“California is fundamentally challenged by increasing variability in
                                        precipitation. Being able to manage this water for all Californians requires
                                        that we develop drought management tools that allow everyone to understand the
                                        consequences of certain actions, as well as to gain insight into potential
                                        remedies,” Viers said. “This investment by CDFA is to create the digital
                                        infrastructure needed for better decision making in a water-scarce world.”</p>

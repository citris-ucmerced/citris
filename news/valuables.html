                      highlights the opportunities and challenges associated
                      with adopting satellite data for water management in the
                      United States. Remotely sensed data have been used in many
                      ways to help inform consequential decisions—

                        notable examples</a
                      >
                      include monitoring drought to mitigate its economic
                      impacts and detecting harmful algal blooms to prevent
                      people and pets from getting sick. But it has not yet been
                      widely adopted at an operational level. That’s where
                      social scientists can help, Kuwayama says. “[Social
                      scientists with expertise in water resources] generally
                      understand how hydrologic information influences water
                      management decisions and how these decisions influence
                      socioeconomically meaningful outcomes.”

                        winners of three grants</a
                      >
                      to support research that quantifies the benefits of using
                      satellite data in decisions that improve socioeconomic
                      benefits for people and/or the environment.

                    <p>
                      The three winning teams are led by Sonia Aziz (Moravian
                      College), Jill Caviglia-Harris (Salisbury University), and
                      Stephen Newbold (University of Wyoming) with
                      transdisciplinary personnel drawn from 11 more academic
                      institutions and organizations. The teams will conduct
                      impact assessments that quantify the societal benefits of
                      using Earth observations in health, ecosystem, and water
                      quality applications.

                      Stephen Newbold (University of Wyoming) leads the
                      development of a model that describes how lake visitors in
                      California adjust their recreation choices when outbreaks
                      of harmful algal blooms are announced. This will improve
                      our current understanding of how early warning systems
                      supported by satellite data allow recreators to divert
                      their visits away from water bodies currently experiencing
                      a bloom, and instead visit un-impacted sites, thereby
                      increasing the overall enjoyment of water-based recreation
                      activities, reducing the risks of adverse health effects,
                      and mitigating the regional economic impacts associated
                      with lost visitation days. The project team includes Sarah
                      Lindley and Shannon Albeke (University of Wyoming), Joshua
                      Viers (University of California, Merced), Robert Johnston
                      (Clark University), and George Parsons (University of
                      Delaware).

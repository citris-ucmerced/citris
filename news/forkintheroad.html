                                        The pandemic changed the way Americans consume food—and for many, exposed them to hunger and food insecurity. UC Merced Prof. Colleen Naughton received a <a href=https://citris-uc.org/news-events/citris-covid-19-response>CITRIS COVID-19 Seed Fund</a> to solve the disruption in the food supply chain. The project aims to create more resilient and equitable systems within the food supply chain by leveraging technology to improve the transfer of information, data, and informatics.  
                                    </p>

                                        In an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, many business and restaurant closed and led to a decrease in demand for food of certain volumes and types. This disruption was what Naughton calls “supply chain pinch points.” She is using life cycle assessments and other systems analysis to identify areas of improvement along the supply chain. Without being able to adapt for consumer markets, food insecurity increased. Naughton and her team collaborated with agriculture and community leaders to bridge the gap between farmers, food, restaurants, retailers and the Merced County Food Bank. Long after the pandemic is over, this research will help to bring together the community, farmers and overall sustainability.

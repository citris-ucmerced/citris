                                    <p>As lead of research inclusion and North America academic development at Google,
                                        Sepi Hejazi Moghadam is transforming computer science education and creating
                                        pathways for a diverse generation of tech leaders. He played a core role in
                                        launching Google’s flagship <a
                                            href="https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/" target="_blank"
                                            rel="noreferrer noopener">exploreCSR</a> outreach program, which has served
                                        students from marginalized or underrepresented groups at more than one hundred
                                        universities across North America and Australasia since its inception in
                                        2018.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Confronting the diversity crisis in tech, Moghadam uses data-driven research on
                                        societal and academic metrics and teacher efficacy to ensure that each of his
                                        programs improves both the diversity of the tech industry and the lives of
                                        participants — a dual mandate few companies have been able to replicate. Through
                                        his efforts, more computer science programs today are lowering the barriers to
                                        entry and improving students’ sense of belonging, which contributes to a more
                                        diverse talent pool and a more dynamic workforce.</p>



                                    <p>Moghadam’s innovative leadership is transforming how educators teach computer
                                        science to be more inclusive and to actively retain women and people of color in
                                        STEM.</p>

                                    <p>Theresa Maldonado’s academic leadership spans more than 30 years across five
                                        universities and includes nearly two decades in strategic research and
                                        administrative roles. Before joining the University of California as vice
                                        president for research and innovation in 2020, she was Dean and Riter Professor
                                        of Engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Maldonado has extensive experience at the federal level in advancing engineering
                                        research, education and commercialization initiatives. From 2011–14, she
                                        directed the National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Education and Centers
                                        (EEC) Division in the Engineering Directorate, where she was responsible for a
                                        $135 million budget in support of interdisciplinary research centers,
                                        innovations in engineering education, broadening participation in engineering
                                        and more.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Throughout her career, Maldonado has championed underrepresented groups in
                                        engineering. At the NSF, she served on the committee that formed and launched
                                        the ADVANCE program, which works to increase the representation and advancement
                                        of women in academic science and engineering careers; chaired the
                                        congressionally mandated Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and
                                        Engineering (CEOSE); and facilitated the development of a multiyear initiative
                                        to investigate how department cultures can negatively impact recruiting and
                                        retention of underrepresented groups. At UTEP, she updated engineering
                                        admissions and advising practices to support a majority Mexican American student
                                        population.</p>



                                    <p>Maldonado was the first person in her family to earn a college degree, as well as
                                        the first Mexican American and the fourth woman to earn a doctorate from Georgia
                                        Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.&nbsp;</p>

                                        interaction include the co-creation of improved robot design and best practices
                                        guidelines for human-robot interactions.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>Among research endeavors spanning disciplines and even continents, Ahumada is the
                                        principal investigator of a $1 million-dollar NSF National Robotics Initiative
                                        (NRI) grant to create better educational robots for children who are restricted
                                        to their homes due to medical conditions or disabilities. She is also a
                                        co-investigator on a $1.2 million UC Multicampus Research Project to create
                                        telemanipulation robots to help protect health care workers and increase social
                                        inclusion for people at high risk of infection.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>In addition to technical innovation, Ahumada has demonstrated leadership in
                                        diversity, equity and inclusion. She was the first female PI of an NRI grant at
                                        UC Irvine and then at UC Davis. She is a member of an all-female team studying
                                        telerobots to increase health care worker safety and reduce isolation for older
                                        adults. She also founded the Latino Excellence and Achievement Awards at UC
                                        Irvine to celebrate academic achievement and raise awareness of the
                                        underrepresentation of Latine scholars in STEM. </p>



                                    <p>Ahumada is a first-generation Mexican American scholar. As a Latina professor
                                        from the United States, she is part of only 1 percent of the UC STEM
                                        professoriate — even though Latines are the largest population group in
                                        California. </p>

                                    <p>The mission of tech nonprofit AnnieCannons is to &#8220;transform survivors of
                                        human trafficking and gender-based violence into software engineers.&#8221; By
                                        teaching students practical skills in computer coding and matching them with
                                        real-world clients, AnnieCannons helps women and trafficking victims support
                                        their lives and independence with their own source of income.&nbsp;</p>



                                    <p>The program starts with data literacy and advances through front-end web
                                        development as students demonstrate mastery. Later phases include full-stack
                                        development, cybersecurity, visual design and more. AnnieCannons has designed a
                                        work environment tailored to their graduates and their families&#8217; needs,

                                            Resilient Infrastructure Systems in the Anthropocene</a>. Professor Markolf
                                        focuses on the idea of making future infrastructure resilient and sustainable by
                                        changing all the surrounding systems that affect it. As time progresses and
                                        society and cities change, we need to adapt infrastructure to change as well.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        One of the main points that Professor Markolf makes is about the Anthropocene.
                                        He discusses it as the “age of humans” and how humanity has caused exponential
                                        changes in many of the systems around us. However, we are not prepared to battle
                                        against or adapt to the rapid changes. Our infrastructure is one of the victims
                                        of these changes. With a rapidly changing environment due to climate change and
                                        greenhouse gases, some buildings and infrastructure cannot adapt to the changes
                                        and face damage which place lives at risk.
                                    </p>

                                        A recent example are the buildings in Texas. Infrastructure in the arid
                                        southwest is built to survive heatwaves and hot summers—not snowstorms. When the
                                        <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/15/us/texas-winter-storm-photos.html
                                            target=_blank>2021 winter storm</a> stretched across Texas their buildings
                                        were not able to handle
                                        it. This caused homes to become dangerously cold and energy systems failed. This
                                        is not the fault of the creators of a lot of Texas infrastructure as the current
                                        method of preparing a building for an area is based on frequency-based design.
                                        This is where the frequency of a disaster happening such as heatwaves are taken
                                        into consideration, and thus, the infrastructure is built to adapt to that
                                        specific risk. According to Markolf, the approach, though, focuses on risk more
                                        implicitly, rather than explicitly.

                                        As the last CITIRS Research Exchange of the spring semester, Professor Markolf’s
                                        presentation was deeply informative and fascinating to watch. If you are

                                    Agricultural Systems. The coalition of researchers is led by UC Merced, joined by
                                    experts from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, <a href="https://ucanr.edu/" target="_blank">UC Agriculture and

                                <p>“There are a lot of challenges in balancing the needs of agriculture and ecosystems,
                                    and climate change and drought are only exacerbating difficult decisions about how
                                    to sustain water resources,” lead Project Director Professor <a
                                        href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/joshua-viers" target="_blank">Joshua Viers</a> said. “But
                                    our team of advisors, educators and scientists are eager to enable data-driven
                                    decision-making for securing a climate resilient future for our water-stressed
                                    regions.”</p>
                                <p>The partners in the USDA funded collaboration — <a
                                        href="http://securewaterfuture.net/"> Securing a Climate Resilient Water Future
                                        for Agriculture and Ecosystems through Innovations in Measurement, Management
                                        and Markets</a> or SWIM — will focus on developing more robust, data-driven
                                    information systems for decision-makers such as land and water managers. SWIM is
                                    designed to provide objective measures of supply and demand, and incorporate drought
                                    forecasting and climate change trends.</p>
                                <p>The research and extension team, by working with local decision-makers, will improve
                                    the accuracy of measurement in water budgets, evaluate novel management strategies
                                    such as on-farm aquifer recharge, and evaluate water trading and markets to improve
                                    sustainable surface and groundwater use.</p>
                                <p>The SWIM project will work across disciplines and stakeholders, integrating research,
                                    extension and education in three testbeds with unique water policies and systems:
                                    Cache Valley, Utah; Mesilla Valley, New Mexico; and the San Joaquin Valley. All of
                                    them grow orchard crops and alfalfa, and all are in a drought. Like California, Utah
                                    is experiencing an unprecedented drought, where 99 percent of the state is in
                                    extreme or exceptional drought. And, like California, the physical and cultural
                                    geography of New Mexico is extremely diverse. Exploring all innovative avenues of
                                    water management is necessary for sustaining a future for agriculture and
                                    surrounding communities while balancing ecosystem needs across the west, Viers said.

                                <p>SWIM’s leadership plans such activities as workshops and field days to actively
                                    engage stakeholders, including the extension-grower networks of each state’s
                                    university system, as well as land, water and ecosystem managers.</p>

                                <p>In addition to the ongoing activity at the UC ANR Kearney Research and Extension
                                    Center, one of the testbeds in California will be the new UC Merced Experimental
                                    Smart Farm.
                                    Researchers there and in the other two regions will collect soil, water and crop
                                    data, track droughts, conduct water accounting and life-cycle assessments, and
                                    produce
                                    user-focused data and analysis.</p>
                                <p>“The western United States is experiencing declining surface water and groundwater,
                                    adding stress on all aspects of the social-hydrological system,” said
                                    co-investigator
                                    Sam Fernald, director of the New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute at New

                                    State University. “The lessons learned in this project will offer a blueprint for
                                    addressing future water challenges, not just in the West, but other locations
                                    worldwide
                                    facing similar water shortage issues.”</p>
                                <p>The researchers want to answer many pressing questions, such as how much the changing
                                    characteristics of multi-year droughts alter people’s willingness to engage in water
                                    trading and banking as part of climate resilience efforts; whether drought early
                                    warning
                                    systems propel water trading; how ecosystem services can be maintained while
                                    adapting
                                    agricultural water management to anticipated extremes; what are the key drivers and
                                    barriers adopting or participating in water markets; and how new data and technology
                                    can
                                    reduce costs and barriers.</p>
                                <p>They will also look at how climate change impacts can be mitigated through a
                                    rainy-day
                                    storage option called managed aquifer recharge or MAR, as well as water trading at
                                    multiple scales and land-use planning so that agriculture and the environment can be
                                    sustained.</p>
                                <p>One key component of creating a sustainable future is through educational
                                    programming,
                                    one of the core activities of the grant. The Climate Adaptation Science Academy will
                                    give affiliated graduate students the jump on their careers as leaders in science
                                    and
                                    engineering by providing training in climate adaptation science, communications and
                                    complex systems problem solving.</p>
                                <p>“Expanding the reach of our program are transformational K-12 educational tools,”
                                    Viers
                                    said. “Educators and graduate students will develop curricular materials for AgSTEM
                                    education pathways reaching from rural, regional middle schools to the teachers
                                    serving
                                    underrepresented groups.”</p>
                                <p>The SWIM team plans to develop such tools as games that support computational
                                    thinking
                                    and decision-making, activities in which students learn about agriculture and
                                    careers in
                                    smart farming, and hands-on experiential learning.</p>

                                    role of UC Merced in providing tangible solutions to pressing societal problems:</p>
                                <p>“It has been clear for some time that water scarcity is our new reality, and we know
                                    we
                                    need to do things differently,” he said. “This research award is the largest that

                                    are the right team with the right ideas to help secure a climate resilient water

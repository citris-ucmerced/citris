                                    <p>When did you decide what you wanted to be when you grow up?</p>

                                    <p>For many talented women, visions of lab coats and microscopes disappear around
                                        middle school. It&rsquo;s a national issue: Science, technology, engineering and
                                        mathematics &mdash; the STEM fields &mdash;comprise proportions of women and
                                        people of color far lower than the population at large. At UC Merced, women make
                                        up 51 percent of the student body, but 40 percent of STEM students, and of that,
                                        only 20 percent are School of Engineering majors.</p>

                                    <p><a href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/valle">&iexcl;Valle!</a>, now in its second
                                        year, helps Central Valley students stay in STEM studies and access
                                        opportunities. The program is open to undergraduates in STEM across the Central
                                        Valley, including community colleges, CSUs and UC, and the deadline to apply has
                                        been extended to Dec. 20.</p>

                                    <p>Google Research exploreCSR (computer science research) is supporting
                                        &iexcl;Valle! as one of many programs, spanning 59 institutions. In 2020,
                                        exploreCSR and programs like Valle served 2,400 students. This year, UCM will
                                        serve over 30 and coordinate with the larger network on research and program
                                        design, sharing what we find across the country.</p>

                                    <p>Led by Professor Erin Hestir, associate director of the <a
                                            href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/valle">Center for Information
                                            Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS)</a>, the tech
                                        career-training program aims to increase access for underrepresented students
                                        &mdash; access to graduate school and research, to a network of peers and
                                        mentors and to lucrative, rewarding careers in a burgeoning field.</p>

                                    <p>&ldquo;Mentorship is such an important piece of the professional success puzzle.
                                        And yet, mentoring is not available to everyone, including some of our best and
                                        brightest women and students of color,&rdquo; Hestir said. &ldquo;Expanding
                                        access to mentorship for the next generation of &lsquo;STEMinists&rsquo; is the
                                        future of innovation and the future of our country.&rdquo;</p>

                                    <p>Hestir works with Professor Kathy Kanemoto, who pioneered the computer science
                                        department at Merced College, leading to drone training, a new major, and many
                                        inspired and supported students transferring to four-year colleges.</p>

                                    <p>&ldquo;In order to move the needle in broadening participation in computer
                                        science we need to get students involved in research,&rdquo; Kanemoto said.
                                        &ldquo;Many of our students have never been exposed to research and Valle has
                                        opened up that pathway for them.&rdquo; Kanemoto also leads regional components
                                        of CAHSI, the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions.&nbsp;</p>

                                            shows women leave STEM for myriad reasons</a>. Topics from personal
                                        confidence and tech skills to presenting their best selves in application
                                        materials and networking are all part of the weekly workshop supported by Google
                                        Research and CITRIS.</p>

                                    <p>Designed for STEM majors and encouraging of women, people of color and first- and
                                        second-year students, &iexcl;Valle! is more than a professional development
                                        program. Expenses are covered and at the end of the workshop, students will have
                                        personal and interpersonal skills and resources to take their next steps.
                                        Working with faculty, mentors and graduate students, participants will build a
                                        network of fellow tech-savvy students and practice skills that will lead to
                                        access, confidence and opportunities in STEM careers.</p>

                                    <p>CITRIS, an institute of science and innovation at four UC campuses, has a clear
                                        initiative for women in technology geared to improve the lives of not only women
                                        in STEM but anyone who engages with technology.</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;A more diverse tech workforce creates more compassionate and
                                        empathetic products,&rdquo; said Jill Finlayson, director of the Women in Tech
                                        program, which addresses the inclusion needs of women from middle school
                                        students to CEOs of tech corporations.</p>

                                    <p>Finlayson points out that undergraduate opportunities come at a critical time.

                                    <p>"&iexcl;Valle!&nbsp;demystifies the pathways to Ph.D.s and jobs in tech with
                                        practical guidance, peer feedback, networking practice, and inspiration from a
                                        diverse leaders who have pursued their passion for STEM and academic careers.
                                        Role models, especially for women of color, are invaluable as they share their
                                        lived experiences and what has worked for them to persist and thrive in tech."

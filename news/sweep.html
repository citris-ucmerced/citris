                                <section>
                                    <p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture&mdash;or CDFA&mdash;recently
                                        added two UC Merced faculty to the advisory group for the <a
                                            href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/oefi/sweep/">State Water Efficiency &amp;
                                            Enhancement Program</a>. SWEEP, as the program is commonly known, added an
                                        Ad Hoc advisory group in response to stakeholders request. The group is
                                        responsible for creating recommendations to help farmers and water managers
                                        improve efficiency and improve participation across the state.</p>
                                    <p>Prof. Josu&eacute; Medell&iacute;n-Azuara and Prof. Sarah Kurtz, both
                                        CITRIS-affiliated researchers and UC Merced School of Engineering faculty, will
                                        contribute their water and energy expertise to the agriculture-focused advisory
                                        board.</p>
                                    <p>While the main goal is water efficiency, SWEEP funds and supports projects that
                                        reduce costs for farmers and ranchers while achieving environmental benefits,
                                        like reducing greenhouse gas emissions or energy for water pumping.</p>
                                    <p>This is one of the many reasons why Josu&eacute; Medell&iacute;n-Azuara,
                                        Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, joined SWEEP in fall
                                        of 2020. &ldquo;The program considers water balance approach without encouraging
                                        acreage expansions. Yet, what I like the most about the SWEEP program is that
                                        <em>irrigation efficiency</em> encompasses not just water but also cleaner
                                        energy.&rdquo;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Medell&iacute;n-Azuara&rsquo;s research has served CDFA in the past, publishing
                                        on <a
                                            href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29WR.1943-5452.0000984">drought
                                            impacts on agricultural labor</a> and <a
                                            href="https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/delta-et">evaporation of water resources
                                            in the Delta agricultural lands</a>. &ldquo;I always thought SWEEP was an
                                        ambitious and worthwhile endeavor.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>The lead of the Water Systems Management Lab at UC Merced, Medell&iacute;n-Azuara
                                        said, &ldquo;Water efficiency in agriculture is complex. Sometimes reductions in
                                        applied water might have unintended consequences for aquifer recharge. Or water
                                        savings might lead to more areas being irrigated.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Combining improvements in irrigation efficiency and reductions in GHG
                                        emissions is a step forward. What really motivated me to join was &nbsp;the
                                        opportunity to include equity elements into the program which provide smaller
                                        farm operations and farmers in underserved communities, with a fair amount of
                                        technical assistance for filling out applications.&rdquo;</p>

                                    <p>Professor of Materials Sciences <a
                                            href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/skurtz/">Sarah Kurtz</a>&rsquo;s
                                        expertise lies more in renewable energy than water, but she is equally devoted
                                        to equity and multiple uses for agricultural lands. In 2019, when she joined the
                                        faculty of UC Merced, Prof. Kurtz hosted with CITRIS a biogas and agriculture
                                        workshop. And since many of SWEEP&rsquo;s programs include solar energy,
                                        Kurtz&rsquo;s leadership in the field and vision for an equitable access to
                                        economical energy will help guide CDFA programming.</p>
                                    <p>Prof. Kurtz said &ldquo;SWEEP is an excellent program that funds farmers to use
                                        irrigation that saves water and reduces greenhouse gases. It&rsquo;s a real
                                        privilege for me to participate on the Ad Hoc Sub-Advisory Group.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Medell&iacute;n-Azuara added that being part of SWEEP is important for our
                                        community. &ldquo;Given UC Merced&rsquo;s growing ties with our surrounding
                                        agricultural community, I felt SWEEP, in addition to my lab&rsquo;s research,
                                        was a good place for me to participate with CDFA.&rdquo;</p>

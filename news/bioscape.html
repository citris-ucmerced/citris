                                    <p>Hestir describes why the “Cape” is such an important place for biodiversity
                                        studies.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>“The Cape contains two global biodiversity hotspots, meaning there’s
                                        a lot of
                                        different species in one area. Not to mention the ocean. It is third in the
                                        world
                                        for the number of unique marine animals that live nowhere else on Earth.” </p>

                                <p>Like California, the Cape’s wildlife and wilderness face pressures like human
                                    population increases, wildfire, water shortages, and climate change.

                                    said Hestir. “Understanding the diversity of life, what drives it and how it might
                                    change in the future is critical to maintaining and protecting life on Earth—for us
                                    and all creatures. NASA’s cutting-edge technology offers us the opportunity to
                                    measure biological diversity like never before to help solve this crisis. And it
                                    can’t happen soon enough.” </p>

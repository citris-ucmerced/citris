                      On May 28, 2024, Plainsburg Elementary buzzed with excitement as UC Merced engineering
                      students introduced local 6th - 8th grade students to the world of drones through a program called
                      FLY CITRIS. With a visit from the UC Merced Mobile Maker Lab, or "Mobi", students
                      experienced new drone technology and unique engineering concepts. Each student was provided
                      the opportunity to fly drones through obstacle courses, enhancing their piloting skills and
                      understanding of aerodynamics. These practical sessions were complemented by conversations
                      on ag-tech applications, where students discovered how drones are revolutionizing agriculture by
                      monitoring crop health, optimizing irrigation, and managing pests. By merging fun, hands-on
                      drone activities with real-world agricultural technology insights, FLY CITRIS not only
                      captivated the students' imaginations but also showcased the transformative potential of drones
                      in modern agricultural practices. Kristi Kingston, the Plainsburg School Superintendent, noted
                      how engaged and entertained the students were with the drones. “This experience was one that
                      some students would have never been able to have without this group. Thank you for partnering
                      with our small, rural school and giving our 6th, 7th, and 8th graders an awesome experience to
                      end the year with."

                      Students at Plainsburg have spent the past 6 weeks learning about robotics through UC Merced
                      CITRIS’ NexTech Robotics program and were eager to learn more skills. "For some kids,
                      'Robotics was the best two days of the week!'" said Plainsburg Elementary School teacher
                      Jennifer Tanachion. CITRIS Education Intern Santiago Ramirez Manzo observed, "working at
                      Plainsburg as a NexTech educator I was able to witness the students’ attitudes towards robotics
                      and engineering concepts grow from reluctant to enthusiastic. The willingness of the students as
                      a whole to participate and engage with NexTech curriculum allowed them to excel in the
                      engineering challenges we presented them with. Overall, my semester spent as a NexTech
                      educator at Plainsburg was an equally exciting, challenging, and rewarding experience."

                      Through FLY CITRIS and its robotics counterpart, NexTech Robotics, UC Merced is not only
                      educating young minds but also fostering a community of learners who are excited about the
                      possibilities of science and ag-tech. By making STEM education accessible and engaging, these
                      programs are helping to shape the future of innovation, one student at a time.

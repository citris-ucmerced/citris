                                        The “Converging COVID-19, environment, health, and equity” conference is the
                                        collaborative effort of UC Merced Professor of Civil and Environmental
                                        Engineering Colleen Naughton, her colleagues from the University of South
                                        Florida, and the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors
                                        (AEESP). The final presentation and panel discussion concludes on Friday,
                                        November 20, but all of the videos are available online on the <a

                                        Each week researchers and faculty present impacts of COVID-19 on various topics.
                                        These topics range from systematic bias and environmental engineering education
                                        to designing a future without pollution and waste. Presenters share short yet
                                        formal talks and discuss across the panel, answering audience questions.
                                        Questions can either be tweeted or sent in Zoom Q&A function where the meeting
                                        is hosted.

                                        As a student at UC Merced , I have found the COVID 19 conference incredibly
                                        interesting and an enjoyable to experience. I personally learned a lot while
                                        watching these conferences and developed a newfound respect for professors and
                                        researchers working through the pandemic.
                                    </p>

                                        Naughton presented on wastewater and early detections of spikes in COVID-19
                                        through human waste. COVID-19 can be spread before any symptoms arrive making it
                                        hard to just track COVID-19 cases through tests, but samples taken from
                                        wastewater treatment sites can illustrate the concentration of COVID-19 in areas
                                        served by that treatment site. Given how little we know about the broad
                                        population, wastewater can be an early indicator.
                                    </p>

                                        Naughton and her lab collaborate with over 140 different universities across the
                                        world to help track COVID cases in those areas and share information through a
                                        dashboard and on twitter handle <a

                                        helped communities
                                        near wastewater treatment sites, universities, and cities and towns as well.
                                        This novel detection method could be a safe means of testing populations.

                                        wastewater treatment, presented in <a

                                        <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/masten/home">Professor Susan Masten from
                                            Michigan State University</a> wanted to ensure her
                                        students were doing well and learning throughout the pandemic. She talked about
                                        the stress COVID-19 has exacted on students, including challenges with learning.
                                        To increase flexibility, she made her lectures prerecorded and uploaded for easy
                                        access, but labs were a different story. Hands-on learning in lab courses are
                                        normally done on campus with assistance and special equipment. Masten created
                                        lab curriculum based on inexpensive and readily available kits. Regardless of
                                        where the student lived, they will be able to perform the experiment outside of
                                        the lab and without paying a heavy price for expensive equipment. She put her
                                        student’s mental health and disposition first and adjusted her curriculum so
                                        they could work efficiently. As a student, I appreciate how this professor
                                        dedicated herself to make sure students can learn through these tough times.

                                    <p>Naughton concluded the session she moderated with sentiments worth sharing here
                                        about the better world we all dream of and are working to create, dedicating the

                                            A future where we utilize green chemistry instead of toxic and hazardous

                                            Imagine a world where fewer people die and suffer from cancer, toxicity and

                                            Imagine a world where the environment is clean <br>
                                            Where we are not finding plastics and toxins in the bellies of birds and

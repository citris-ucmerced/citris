                                <p>Breaking barriers and building bridges: Over the course of three transformative days, ¡Valle! Get Your
                                    Start in Tech! empowered 27 students from California’s Central Valley to reimagine their futures in STEM.
                                    Hosted by the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and Banatao
                                    Institute at UC Merced, the sixth annual workshop combined hands-on learning, career-building tools,
                                    and community connection to pave pathways for underrepresented students into tech and research
                                    careers—one pitch, code, and connection at a time. When Linda Garcia first attended ¡Valle! as a
                                    freshman four years ago, she learned skills in making an elevator pitch and networking. This year, Linda
                                    had the opportunity to return to the program as a ¡Valle! Ambassador, gaining an opportunity to further
                                    build her skills and mentor others starting out on their journey in STEM. Linda said, <b> “I attended ¡Valle!
                                    during my freshman year at UC Merced. When I returned this year, I realized that the skills I had
                                    learned during my first Valle have improved tremendously over the course of 4 years. Skills I’ve
                                    learned such as making an elevator pitch and networking have helped me to get an internship at my
                                    dream job, which led to a full-time role. The skills learned at this event are not taught in classes and
                                    are essential for being successful in the field. Valle helped change my life."</b></p>

                                    During an intensive three-day event, students learned with tools to navigate careers in technology. The
                                    program emphasized skill-building, networking, and increasing self-confidence for students in STEM
                                    fields. Participants attended career talks, coding workshops, and networking sessions designed to
                                    connect them with peers, industry professionals, and faculty. Throughout the weekend, students built
                                    their communication and networking skills, learned new coding skills with Google Earth Engine and
                                    drones, attended career talks, worked on application materials for jobs and internships, networked
                                    through LinkedIn, and grew their STEM communities. These activities aimed to enhance career readiness
                                    as well as the students’ sense of belonging within the tech and STEM communities.

                                    A common theme throughout the weekend focused on the importance of networking, touched on by
                                    many of the speakers who gave examples of the power of networking in their own career journeys. The
                                    students practiced their own elevator pitches and had the chance to share them in a real networking
                                    setting to mentors from industry and academia during a formal business dinner in downtown Merced.

                                            Extramural Funding Fellowship</a> (EFF) program helps early-career faculty
                                        learn key ways to synthesize their work for wider audiences. The aim of the
                                        program is to support faculty in the pursuit of extramural funding, with the
                                        goal of growing UC Merced’s research enterprise, advancing concepts in science,
                                        and enhancing national health and welfare.</p>



                                    <p>For the 2021 EFF cohort, CITRIS and the Office of Research and Economic
                                        Development at UC Merced are co-sponsoring two early-career faculty members
                                        pursuing novel technology research.</p>



                                    <p>“Despite the training we receive in graduate school, the professor career path
                                        requires constant growth,” said Joshua Viers, director of CITRIS at UC Merced.
                                        According to the <a href="https://www.facultydiversity.org/" target="_blank"

                                            Diversity</a>, early-career faculty highly benefit from mentoring,
                                        connections with colleagues, and access to new resources.</p>



                                    <p>The 2021 EFF program began in January with grant writing training and will
                                        continue throughout the spring semester. Fellows will also have the opportunity
                                        to visit congressional and agency leaders in Washington, D.C.</p>

                                            rel="noreferrer noopener">Spencer Castro</a>, a new faculty member in
                                        Management of Complex Systems who is building on a family legacy. His
                                        grandfather self-produced safety videos for arborists and started the
                                        Yosemite
                                        National Park prescribed burning program. Both his parents fought wildland
                                        fires, and growing up in Yosemite gave Castro first-hand experience with
                                        challenges faced by local communities.</p>



                                    <p>“As someone who has evacuated many times and has multiple family members
                                        scattered throughout the foothills, I would personally like to help find
                                        solutions to these problems,” said Castro. He wants to improve how we
                                        educate
                                        communities about wildfires. “Like other natural disasters, the
                                        intermittence of
                                        fire leads to apathy when easily accessible training and proper preparation
                                        could save lives, especially in nearby communities.”</p>



                                    <p>His work is precisely geared at enabling smart decision-making to prepare
                                        Californians for the next big fire. “The EFF training will provide me with
                                        the
                                        skills to create a sustainable research program and increase confidence when
                                        interacting with large government agencies,” Castro said. The practical
                                        nature
                                        of his work is also supported by cognitive science, and a long-range goal of

                                        is to develop a human-computer interaction lab that tests the cognitive
                                        workload
                                        during disasters. “I want to improve the safety of everyday technologies,
                                        and
                                        especially those used in emergencies.”</p>

                                            rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebecca Ryals</a> is famous for getting her
                                        hands
                                        dirty, turning all matter of waste—including human waste—into fertilizer for
                                        agriculture. And her work doesn’t stop there. Storing waste in a useable
                                        format
                                        reduces greenhouse gases and more. “Healthy soils feed us. Climate change is
                                        a
                                        wicked problem but there are many solutions. The way we steward soils and
                                        their
                                        incredible capacity to store carbon can help solve our climate crisis. More
                                        carbon in the soil improves our ability to grow food, reduces nutrient
                                        pollution, and more efficiently use water,” said Ryals.</p>



                                    <p>Her work contributes to a growing body of literature around the idea that
                                        agriculture is both the contributor and the solution to climate change. By
                                        composting everything from manure to human waste, Ryals is closing the loop
                                        through agroecology. Ryals recently discussed her work during a <a

                                        interview.</p>



                                    <p>When asked about the EFF program Ryals said, “I am excited about this
                                        training.
                                        For me, it is an opportunity to not only hone my grant writing skills, but
                                        also
                                        to learn how to more successfully navigate the complex funding
                                        ecosystem.”&nbsp;
                                    </p>



                                    <p>Castro and Ryals recognize the importance of growing as successful faculty
                                        and
                                        community members. “As scientists, we have the incredible privilege to
                                        explore
                                        the world by asking questions, collecting data, and building onto the wealth
                                        of
                                        knowledge in the world,&#8221; said Ryals. &#8220;I want to use that

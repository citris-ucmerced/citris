                                    found her passion in remote sensing. The doctoral student is leading cutting-edge
                                    remote sensing research,
                                    applying satellite technology to wildfire and water quality issues. Using satellites
                                    and writing programs to
                                    interpret data to reveal hidden problems in water resources is one of the

                                    known as the NASA FINESST Program. Her proposal on wildfire and water supply was
                                    selected from 835
                                    highly competitive proposals, 351 of which were in Earth Science. The program

                                <p>Given California’s approaching wildfire season and the well-documented increase
                                    in intensity, size and frequency of fires, Lopez Barreto’s work is extremely
                                    timely. The fires leave soils bare and disturbed making them susceptible to
                                    erosion. The sediments make their way through hillsides and streams to
                                    reservoirs. The proposal titled "Wildfire Effects on Water Quality in California
                                    Water Supply Reservoirs" will use satellite data to calculate the levels of
                                    sediment and blue-green algae in water and examine the traits of different
                                    wildfires across the state over the past 30 years to provide in-depth watershed
                                    analysis for water managers across the state. </p>
                                <p>A major portion of Western water supply comes from lands where wildfires are a
                                    frequent and growing concern, but the effects of the wildfire activities in
                                    these watersheds, and risks posed to public water supplies are little
                                    understood. As wildfires in the Western U.S. are a commonplace event,
                                    quantifying and predicting the effects of fire on water resources is critical
                                    for meeting our current and future water needs. </p>
                                <p>“This cascade of potential consequences make it dire to understand the
                                    relationship wildfire has on water quality in order to prepare for the future
                                    under climate change. California’s unique climate and ecosystems afford new
                                    insights on wildfire’s role on water quality in a landscape that has been facing
                                    an increasing amount of wildfire,” said Lopez Barreto.</p>
                                <p>As an advisor, Hestir has seen tremendous growth all areas that lead to a strong
                                    professor,
                                    from research to teaching to mentorship. Hestir said, “We in California are lucky to
                                    have
                                    talented young researchers turning their attention to our water and wildfire issues
                                    as¬ the
                                    two are inextricably linked. Brittany’s focus on wildfire effects on water quality
                                    is critical,
                                    but until now understudied aspect of water security and wildfire risk for our
                                    communities.
                                    We in Merced are doubly lucky to have Brittany’s skill and passion for teaching and
                                    mentoring.”</p>
                                <p>Lopez Barreto started her environmental career pursuing a Bachelors of Science at
                                    UC Davis in Environmental Science and Management and upon completion, directly
                                    joined UC Merced’s transdisciplinary Environmental Systems program. She also is
                                    a teaching assistant for engineering courses on Remote sensing of the

                                <p>As a first-generation Latina, she recognizes how rare she is in STEM. “I believe
                                    it is important to be present and to share experiences in STEM to show that STEM
                                    is possible for anyone who is interested,” said Lopez Barreto. “I thoroughly
                                    enjoyed speaking to them on a more intimate level because ultimately one’s
                                    educational and career path is not entirely black and white, especially coming
                                    from a disadvantaged background.”</p>
                                <p>“Professors are in a special position to be able to grow the next generation of
                                    future environmental leaders. A professor’s work does not stop at just academia
                                    and research, but also extends to outreach and service. And that’s part of what
                                    intrigues me about this higher education career path,” said Lopez Barreto. The
                                    work will be shared with water managers across the state. </p>

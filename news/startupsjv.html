                                    <p>The technology world is punctuated by startups, and UC Merced is “starting up”
                                        its own program to invigorate computer science education in the San Joaquin
                                        Valley.</p>
                                    <p>The National Science Foundation awarded a $300,000, two-year grant to support
                                        START UP SJV, which stands for “STEM Teachers Alliance for Regional Tech
                                        thinking through Underrepresented Professional development in the San Joaquin
                                        Valley.”</p>
                                    <p>Computer science <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/angelo-kyrilov">
                                            Teaching Professor Angelo Kyrilov </a> is leading the effort along with
                                        computer science <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/stefano-carpin">
                                            Professor Stefano Carpin </a> and Chelsea Arnold, the campus’s <a
                                            href="https://calteach.ucmerced.edu/">CalTeach</a> program director and an
                                        assistant project scientist in environmental soil physics.</p>
                                    <p>The three applied for the grant to address an issue they noticed in the classes
                                        they teach at UC Merced.</p>
                                    <p>“Some of my students struggle with basic computing principles,” Kyrilov said.
                                        “They grasp the structure and goals, but do not engage in the beauty of
                                        computing. It’s like the difference between plunking piano keys and playing the
                                        piano with expression and control.”</p>
                                    <p>Kyrilov worked with the Merced County Office of Education and Merced Union High
                                        School District and found that few high school students were taking, much less
                                        passing, the advanced placement exams. He created coding resources and engaged
                                        with students but realized a longer-term strategy would be to work with the
                                        teachers.</p>
                                    <p>Through the new grant, UC Merced undergraduates can participate in a course to
                                        support middle and high school teachers trying new computer science curricula.
                                        The class, taught by Kyrilov, will answer computer science questions and help
                                        build a network of teachers and undergraduate students.</p>
                                    <p>“When it comes to inspiring young minds, computer science is today’s Tinker Toys
                                        and ERECTOR sets,” <a href="https://engineering.ucmerced.edu/">School of
                                            Engineering</a> Dean Mark Matsumoto said. “We want students to see what
                                        doors computer science can open for them in the future.”</p>
                                    <p>“This exciting cross-school partnership focuses our shared expertise on one of
                                        our primary goals — to improve K-12 educational outcomes and train a skilled
                                        workforce for the San Joaquin Valley and beyond,” <a
                                            href="https://naturalsciences.ucmerced.edu/"> School of Natural Sciences
                                        </a> Dean Betsy Dumont said. “It sets the stage for a wealth of future
                                        collaborations.”</p>
                                    <p>Computer science and engineering is the second-largest undergraduate major at UC
                                        Merced, with more than 1,000 students enrolled per year. Not all of them will
                                        work for tech giants or start their own companies — many will become teachers,
                                        too.</p>
                                    <p>Carpin, the founding chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
                                        at UC Merced, said he’s happy to see computer science studies growing and
                                        expanding to middle and high school students, and Arnold said she is most
                                        excited about engaging area teachers.</p>
                                    <p>“This program opens the door for some of our students to share their enthusiasm
                                        for computer science with Valley middle and high school students,” she said.
                                        “This program is a way to address the problem through enhanced content knowledge
                                        and a robust support system for our diverse teachers to help them be even more
                                        prepared when they enter the classroom to teach computer science.”</p>
                                    <p>The new program will support computer science educators from middle and high
                                        schools through in-person and online professional development and support from
                                        UC Merced. They will also help UC Merced conduct research about how the students
                                        learn and engage with the curricula. Teacher recruitment begins in early 2021,
                                        and each participating teacher will receive a $2,000 stipend upon completing the
                                        program.</p>
                                    <p>“Evaluating the program throughout will enable us to know what works and what
                                        doesn’t,” Kyrilov said.</p>
                                    <p>Data will be collected and analyzed by ERC Data in Fresno, an external evaluation
                                        team specializing in educational programs — after all, scaling up is what
                                        successful startups do.</p>
                                    <p>For <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/joshua-viers"> Professor Josh Viers
                                        </a> , director of UC Merced’s <a href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/"> Center
                                            for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society </a>
                                        (CITRIS), the proposal aligns with much of the work he and his colleagues have
                                        been conducting since the university began.</p>
                                    <p>“We’re participating in a grand experiment: Can a large public university make a
                                        difference in the San Joaquin Valley? This NSF award is validation that our
                                        university is creating pathways for students to succeed in the jobs of the
                                        future and to give back to the communities from which they came,” he said.</p>
                                    <p>CITRIS, which runs a middle school NexTech Robotics program taught by UC Merced
                                        students, supported the proposal development because of its focus on technology
                                        and dedication to improving diversity in technology.</p>
                                    <p>Designed to address the shortage of math and science teachers in California’s
                                        schools, especially the San Joaquin Valley, CalTeach, which is part of the
                                        School of Natural Sciences, has graduated more than 150 UC Merced students and
                                        has alumni teaching from Mariposa to the Bay Area and from Los Angeles to
                                        Sacramento.</p>
                                    <p>“We’re seeing an increase in computer science majors in our education classes,”
                                        Arnold said. “Our students gain exposure to teaching through many of our
                                        outreach programs, from Bobcat Summer Academy to the CalTeach Learning Lab, and
                                        they can see the potential to change young people’s lives through education.”

                                    study.</p>

                                    the paper with researchers Andrew Zumkehr, Jenny Ta and Elliot Campbell in
                                    collaboration with UC Water and Professor Brandi McKuin of UC Santa Cruz, an alumna
                                    of UC Merced.</p>
                                <p>The research explores the interconnected nature and costs of moving water across the
                                    state. It tested the thesis that by erecting a modular system of solar shading
                                    panels over California’s exposed aqueducts, the state can reduce evaporative water
                                    loss and provide a variety of benefits when compared to conventional ground-mounted
                                    solar systems. The Solar AquaGrid study was underwritten by NRG Energy, with
                                    development support from the Bay Area agency Citizen Group.</p>
                                <p>Results show a savings of 63 billion gallons of water annually, which is comparable
                                    to the amount needed to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or meet the residential
                                    water needs of more than 2 million people. And the 13 gigawatts of solar power the
                                    solar panels would generate each year would equal about one sixth of the state’s
                                    current installed capacity — roughly half the projected new capacity needed by 2030
                                    to meet the state’s decarbonization goals.</p>
                                <p>“The SolarAqua Grid model provides a combined, integrated response to addressing our
                                    water/energy nexus,” Bales said. “It can help address California’s underlying
                                    vulnerabilities while meeting both state and federal level commitments to produce
                                    renewable energy, lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
                                    Solutions such as these are not only viable but more urgently needed than ever
                                    before, particularly as the region returns to what many researchers refer to as a
                                    paleo-drought — a worst-case scenario for water managers.”</p>
                                <p>“We were surprised by the significant evaporation savings, which we project to be as
                                    much as 82%,” added UC Santa Cruz postdoctoral scholar Brandi McKuin, lead author of
                                    the report. “That amount of water can make a significant difference in water-short
                                    regions.” </p>
                                <p>Because the solar panels shade the canals from direct sunlight, McKuin added, they
                                    would not only mitigate evaporation but also curtail the growth of aquatic weeds and
                                    reduce maintenance costs, while the evaporation that does occur actually cools the
                                    panels, increasing their efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity.</p>
                                <p>The analysis shows that adding solar coverings above canals that run across ‘already
                                    disturbed land’ means developers can avoid protracted environmental permitting and
                                    right-of-way issues so systems can be deployed more quickly and cost effectively.
                                </p>
                                <p>The study estimates that, for California, the resulting annual savings in maintenance
                                    costs could be as much as $40,000 per mile of canal. In addition, the retirement of
                                    old diesel pumps and generators in favor of solar arrays would contribute to cleaner
                                    air in California’s Central Valley, which suffers from among the worst air quality
                                    in the nation.</p>
                                <p> “What is most compelling about this study is that when you tally up the multiple
                                    benefits,” Bales said, “solar over canals represents the sort of shift in thinking
                                    that California and the world need as we transition our economy and infrastructure
                                    to a fossil-free, sustainable future.” </p>
                                <p>The UC Solar AquaGrid study comes at a time when there is growing urgency for
                                    shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy. UC engineers are rethinking how
                                    aging water and energy infrastructure can adapt to the challenges of sustainable
                                    water management, catastrophic wildfires, multi-day power outages and the American
                                    West’s "megadrought” — an ongoing stretch of extended dry conditions worse than any
                                    experienced since 1603, according to a recent report in the journal Science.</p>
                                <p>The Biden administration has called for rapid modernization of water, transportation
                                    and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate. Federal
                                    agencies have been directed to identify new opportunities to spur innovation,
                                    commercialization and deployment of clean-energy technologies and infrastructure.
                                </p>
                                <p>California is calling for 50% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by
                                    2030 and the sale of all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035.</p>
                                <p>This study demonstrates one way to further the mission of sustainability by using
                                    existing structures.</p>
                                <p>“Aqueducts are the arteries of our economic and social development, and have captured
                                    the public’s imagination for centuries,” said former State Water Board Chair Felicia
                                    Marcus. “A significant amount of our state’s electricity bill comes from moving,
                                    treating and heating water, so water efficiency is also energy efficiency. We need
                                    to find every way we can to use water more efficiently, including stemming
                                    evaporative loss, as we also scale up clean energy to meet the needs of the
                                    challenging century ahead under climate change.”</p>

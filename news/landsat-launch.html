                                <h1>What is LandSat-9 and why is it important?</h1>
                                <p>Launched into orbit on September 27th, 2021, Landsat-9 is NASA’s first satellite to
                                    take images of the earth in 13 years. Continuing the nearly 50-year legacy of
                                    providing tremendous coverage and detail of Earth’s surface, the satellite will work
                                    in tandem with Landsat-8 to provide temporal coverage of observations and image the
                                    entire Earth every eight days, providing over 700 images per day. </p>
                                <p>The data provided by the Landsat satellites are essential for informed land use
                                    decisions and observations on climate change. Currently, the data provided displays
                                    information about Earth’s vegetation, land use, coastlines and surface water, and
                                    much more. Over the past half century of collected data depicts the history of how
                                    the planet has changed and natural disturbances such as fires, hurricanes, and even
                                    insect outbreaks that have occurred. Over time, researchers working with Landsat
                                    data are able to extend the ability to measure changes on the global land surface at
                                    a scale where we can even separate human and natural causes of change. </p>

                                <h1> The Inventor of Landsat, Virginia T. Norwood
                                </h1>
                                <p>Born in 1927, Virginia Norwood grew up with a high aptitude with numbers and logic
                                    puzzles. Like many American women at the time, she was met with societal barriers
                                    throughout her life: being told to apply her strengths as a librarian by her high
                                    school guidance counselor. graduated Salutatorian from her high school Norwood
                                    attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1944. After graduation, Norwood
                                    found it very difficult getting hired as a woman, as she would often be met with
                                    incredulity of her abilities over a man, and asked to make promises to not get
                                    pregnant if hired. </p>
                                <p>In 1948, she found an opportunity to work at Evans Signal Lab, where she designed and
                                    patented the first device to accurately calculate wind velocity above 100,000 ft,
                                    making long-term weather prediction possible for the first time. She would later go
                                    on to design and patent a novel and long classified tracking antenna using
                                    polarization in the early 1950s. </p>
                                <p>Norwood continued her work in the field of microwave antennas, creating IFF antennas
                                    at the MIT Rad Lab. At Hughes Aircraft, where she rose to leadership positions,
                                    Norwood designed communications equipment for the Surveyor, so it could receive
                                    commands and send images and data back to Earth. </p>
                                <p>After the Surveyor project, Norwood took a step back from weaponry and space
                                    exploration to pursue a new project--a satellite that would observe Earth and
                                    monitor its resources. Led by NASA and the USGS, Norwood scrapped initial plans for
                                    an RBV camera, proposing to utilize a Multispectral Scanner (MSS) instead. Hughes
                                    Aircraft supported the scanner with funding and Norwood overcame sceptics through
                                    high quality images of famous places: her test of the MSS at Yosemite Valley and San
                                    Francisco led to a both-and approach. NASA resolved the conflict by utilizing both
                                    the RBV and MSS on launch of Landsat 1 on July 23, 1972. The RBV camera nearly
                                    caused mission-ending complications, while Norwood’s MSS held up and continued
                                    sending high quality data. Norwood would continue to work on the next four versions
                                    of Landsat, all with versions of her MSS.
                                </p>

                                <p>CITRIS at UC Merced hosted a “Ready for Blast Off” watch event with undergraduates,
                                    graduate students, and staff celebrating the launch. With masks on and donuts and
                                    coffees in hand, the satellite afficionados sat in anticipation as the timer counted
                                    down. The group discussed topics regarding SpaceX’s Starlink satellites and
                                    renewable energy aviation. Live on site, Dr. Erin Hestir shared the experience and
                                    energy from Vandenburg Air Force Base via zoom.</p>
                                <p>When the time for launch arrived, the group counted down with the broadcast from NASA
                                    tv, “10, 9, 8, …, 3, 2, 1.” The group watched as the Atlas V rocket took off and
                                    listened in on rumbling from Dr. Hestir’s end. They remarked and were awed by the
                                    speed of the rocket, how quickly it reached an altitude of 437 miles above Earth’s
                                    surface, and the beautiful feed of the boosters detaching from the main body and
                                    falling back to Earth. </p>
                                <h1>Earth Observation at UC Merced</h1>
                                <p>Dr. Erin Hestir’s Earth Observation and Remote Sensing lab (EORS) has a wide variety
                                    of projects that utilize Landsat imagery to investigate the impacts of climate
                                    change on Earth’s ecosystems. The EORS lab group’s research has a particular focus
                                    on aquatic ecosystem, ranging from arctic to tidal wetlands, estuaries, lakes, and
                                    rivers. </p>
                                <p>Tasos Tentoglou, a senior in Environmental Engineering, and Brittany Lopez Barreto, a
                                    4th year PhD student in Environmental Systems, have both used Landsat to investigate
                                    the impacts of wildfires on California terrestrial and aquatic environments. Over
                                    the past few decades, the Western U.S. has seen a record number of wildfires. These
                                    large wildfires, intensified by climate change, leave significant impacts upon many
                                    ecosystems. Tasos has used Landsat 8 to understand the Mendocino Complex Fire burn
                                    scar to formulate insights of wildfire impacts on land albedo and albedo recovery.
                                    Monitoring and understanding water quality responses to watershed dynamics and
                                    wildfire is an important source of information for water managers that is necessary
                                    to develop and prioritize mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring water quality and
                                    water supply. Brittany has used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 to investigate post-wildfire
                                    effects on water quality by deriving multi-decadal water quality trends in
                                    California lakes and supply reservoirs in conjunction with occurrence, frequency,
                                    and intensity of wildfires in adjoining watersheds. Brittany created a time series
                                    of water quality trends for variables, such as turbidity since 1984. </p>
                                <p>EORS Assistant Research Specialist, Julia Burmistrova, has been using Landsat to
                                    examine the effects of lithium salt mining on deserts. The increased consumer demand
                                    for lithium-ion batteries is leading to increased lithium mining globally. For
                                    mining operations, a previously bare desert is converted to shallow salt evaporation
                                    ponds, which changes the reflectivity of the desert. Landsat provides consistent
                                    measurements of reflected and emitted energy at the spatial resolution necessary to
                                    quantify seasonal albedo changes due to lithium mining. For this project, Julia and
                                    collaborators used Landsat time-series data to monitor the expansion of lithium salt
                                    ponds over time and long-term changes in desert surface albedo.</p>
                                <p>Postdoctoral scholar Dr. Dulcinea Avouris is currently using Landsat 8 data to create
                                    turbidity and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) products for the San Francisco
                                    Delta. These water quality parameters are then used to investigate spatio-temporal
                                    (that is, location and time) variability in the Delta. In addition, the turbidity &
                                    CDOM retrievals are used as optical proxies for modeling the distribution of mercury
                                    and methylmercury throughout the Delta. Methylmercury bioaccumulates in fish and
                                    could be harmful to humans if they eat the fish or drink the water. The high spatial
                                    resolution of Landsat is key to visualizing and assessing optical parameters in
                                    smaller water bodies.</p>

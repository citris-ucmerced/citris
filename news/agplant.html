                                    <p>One of the biggest challenges in managing crops, especially in large fields, is
                                        knowing how much water each section of a field needs. Determining that
                                        accurately is a cumbersome process that requires people to hand-pluck individual
                                        leaves from plants, put them in pressure chambers and apply air pressure to see
                                        when water begins to leak from the leaf stems.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>That kind of testing is time consuming and means that farmers can only reach so
                                        many areas of a field each day and cannot test as frequently as they should.
                                    </p>

                                        </a> and professors Konstantinos Karydis and Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury at UC
                                        Riverside recently received a more than $1 million grant from the U.S.
                                        Department of Agriculture through the National Science Foundation’s National
                                        Robotics Initiative to address these challenges.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>They are developing a robotic pressure chamber that can harvest its own sample
                                        leaves and test them on site, immediately, to provide the freshest data. The
                                        system will work to gather data even in large fields, and over a period of time
                                        rather than just providing a snapshot.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Having field data that’s updated frequently can help farmers plan irrigation
                                        frequency and conserve water, optimize the time and effort spent by crop
                                        specialists, and help decrease some of the costs in the food-production chain.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Current measuring techniques involve collecting leaf samples and transporting all
                                        of them to an off-site location, where testers can use very accurate, expensive
                                        pressure chambers; and sampling and analyzing leaf samples in the field using
                                        hand-held pressure chambers, Karydis explained.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In the first category, leaf samples can get mixed up, making it impossible to
                                        track them back to the specific areas of the field they came from, Karydis said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“In addition, the properties of the leaf might vary given the time elapsed
                                        between being sampled and being analyzed, which in turn may yield misleading
                                        results,” he said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Hand-held instruments in the field can be less accurate, but testing can be done
                                        multiple times with different leaves from the same plants, but this method is
                                        time- and labor-intensive, and must be undertaken by specially trained
                                        personnel, he said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“If we’re going to use precision agriculture, we need the most accurate
                                        information-gathering systems we can make,” Carpin said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>He has already worked with colleagues at UCs Davis and Berkeley to create the <a
                                            href="https://uc-merced.foleon.com/public-relations/the-future-of-machines/the-future-of-machines/">
                                            Robot-Assisted Precision Irrigation Delivery (RAPID) </a> system, which
                                        travels along rows of crops adjusting irrigation flows according to sensor data
                                        that tells the robot precisely what’s needed for each plant.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>They’ll use the same base robot as RAPID, but equip it with GPS and a pressure
                                        chamber being designed by the researchers at Riverside, and pair it with drones
                                        that can survey the fields and direct the robot to areas of interest.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“Using this process, farmers could survey plants all day long, even in large
                                        fields,” Carpin said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The four-year project will support graduate students as well as summer research
                                        opportunities for undergraduates. The project has four phases: development of
                                        the chamber; developing machine-vision so the robot can “see” the water coming
                                        from the leaf stems; coordinating multiple robots — in the air and on the
                                        ground; and evaluation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The researchers plan to have the first set of automated pressure chamber
                                        prototypes fabricated by Spring 2021, and to evaluate their performance and
                                        refine designs in controlled settings over Spring and Summer 2021. They expect
                                        to have a completed setup by Winter 2022 so they can begin controlled field
                                        testing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“We have to be quick about it because if we miss a peak growing season, we have
                                        to wait another nine months for the next one,” Carpin said. “We’d like to be
                                        able to start testing next summer and test every summer, and we need to be able
                                        to maximize the tests.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>When all of the components have been designed, the designs and code will be open
                                        source, and all the data collected during the project will be made available to
                                        the scientific community, the researchers wrote in their proposal.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The project came about after Carpin and Viers, director of the <a

                                            Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) </a> at UC Merced, had been
                                        talking with area farmers about the challenges of growing almonds and grapes.
                                        Professors Karydis and Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury had been hearing the same
                                        challenges from citrus and avocado growers in the Riverside area, so the four
                                        partnered up.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“This research partnership with UC Riverside will advance our capabilities in
                                        precision food systems broadly, and most importantly contribute to the presence
                                        of UC Merced and CITRIS in the emerging San Joaquin Valley ag-food-tech sector,”
                                        Viers said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“California agriculture presents a challenge in terms of scalability,” Carpin
                                        said, “but this an exciting collaboration because we’ll get to develop a system
                                        that will work on different kinds of crops.”

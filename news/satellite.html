                      Summertime means fun in the water. As temperatures
                      increase, algal blooms may grow in freshwater and marine
                      ecosystems. Some algae are natural and life-giving, while
                      others are the result of life out of balance and can have
                      harmful effects. Consisting of bacteria and tiny plankton,
                      they arise quickly and alter the ecosystem by consuming
                      available oxygen, killing fish. They also pose a human
                      health risk as some of the algal blooms emit
                      toxins—including
                      <a href="http://projects.dailynews.com/blue-green-algae/">

                      and harmful to people. Detecting algal blooms from space
                      is one way to prevent exposure. Analyzing how people react
                      to harmful algal blooms in another.

                      This project will improve our current understanding of how
                      early warning systems supported by satellite data allow
                      recreators to divert their visits away from water bodies
                      currently experiencing a bloom, and instead visit
                      un-impacted sites, thereby increasing the overall
                      enjoyment of water-based recreation activities, reducing
                      the risks of adverse health effects, and mitigating the
                      regional economic impacts associated with lost visitation
                      days. “The important breakthrough in this research will be
                      to put a dollar value on the economic benefit of
                      information technology applied to environmental problems
                      that directly affect things we value, like recreation and
                      water quality,” said Viers.

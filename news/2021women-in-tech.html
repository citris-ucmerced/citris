                                    <p>Teenie Matlock is the Vice Provost for Academic Personnel and a professor of
                                        Cognitive Science at UC Merced. She has published over 100 peer-reviewed
                                        articles and has been awarded over $2M in extramural research funding. Matlock
                                        pioneered human-computer interaction research in the early 2000s, well before
                                        the ubiquity of attentive systems, and continues to push the boundaries of
                                        language processing through a deeper understanding of human communication. She
                                        is notably transdisciplinary in her approaches, meshing research across
                                        cognitive linguistics, experimental psychology, and human-computer interaction.
                                        At UC Merced, Matlock has broken down academic hierarchies and spearheaded an
                                        effort to hire new faculty using innovative approaches to inclusivity, and
                                        initiated the institutional membership to the National Center for Faculty
                                        Development and Diversity. Her commitment to guide women to succeed in
                                        technology is reflected through the expanded career opportunities she has opened
                                        for her mentees. Her mentorship has led to her mentees’ acceptance to top
                                        graduate programs, obtaining tenure-track positions, achieving tenure, or
                                        landing competitive positions in the technology industry.</p>

                                    <p>Matlock is one of the few Native American faculty in the University of California
                                        system and served as Vice Chair of the American Indian Council of Mariposa. She
                                        continues to build community by inviting Native American Miwok tribal leaders to
                                        open lectures that focus on tribal rights and to honor the location of UC Merced
                                        on ancestral lands. Annually, she has served as a liaison to the local
                                        communities surrounding UC Merced through various outreach and engagement
                                        events. Beyond being a top scholar in her field, Matlock is also a musician and
                                        participates in the Merced Community Jazz Band as a solo trumpet player.</p>

                                    <p>Sheila Warren is the Head of Blockchain, Digital Assets, and Data Policy at the
                                        World Economic Forum (WEF). Sheila’s focus on building solutions to real-world
                                        problems has helped shape the space of blockchain technology and digital
                                        identity. Her first technical contribution was the 2013 launch of NGOsource, a
                                        first-of-its-kind SaaS product that focused on international grantmaking and
                                        revolutionized the way diligence in the sector is conducted using algorithms and
                                        blockchain technology. At the WEF she oversaw the development of the first
                                        proof-of-concept to combat corruption in public procurement. She has become one
                                        of the most influential women in blockchain. Her co-authored paper “Blockchain
                                        Beyond the Hype” is the most downloaded WEF paper of the decade. She has
                                        provided testimony to the EU and UK Parliament, served on high-level advisory
                                        boards for the OECD, World Bank, California government, and several critical
                                        projects. Her insistence on inclusion and problem solving has already shaped the
                                        trajectory of this technology, and she conceived of and oversaw the creation of
                                        the world’s first comprehensive guides to central bank digital currencies and
                                        blockchain for the supply chain. The Presidio Principles, which launched under
                                        her leadership, are the first ethical framework for blockchain technology.</p>

                                    <p>Sheila’s current team is staffed entirely by women, a rare representation in the
                                        field of blockchain. As a leader, she does not hide her personal
                                        responsibilities. She emphasizes new models of leadership and flexible work that
                                        better accommodate the realities of modern life. Her openness about being a
                                        mother of young children and the complexities of work-life balance are inspiring

                                    <p>Katia Vega is an Assistant Professor at the UC Davis Department of Design and
                                        directs the Interactive Organisms Lab. Katia&#8217;s pioneering research creates
                                        novel interfaces around the skin and within fungal colonies known as Beauty
                                        Technologies, Growable Interfaces, and Interactive Tattoos. This research
                                        integrates electronics into cosmetics to be applied directly to skin,
                                        fingernails, and hair to transform the body’s surface into an interactive
                                        platform. Her work in Beauty Technology (a term she introduced in 2012) helped
                                        open a field with innovations like Conductive Makeup, Tech Nails, Hairware, and
                                        FX e-makeup. Katia’s research helped open a new subfield in Wearable Computing
                                        by transforming the body into an interactive platform. Her work has been
                                        featured by the BBC, New Scientist, Wired, Discovery, CNN, and has received
                                        awards from SXSW, Ars Electronica, and the Ubimedia Competition, among others.
                                        She is the co-author of the book, &#8220;Beauty Technology: Designing Seamless
                                        Interfaces for Wearable Computing.”</p>

                                    <p>As a Geek Girl LatAm Ambassador, Katia has a marked impact in encouraging Latina
                                        and female students to undertake STEAM disciplines. Seventy percent of the
                                        undergraduate students joining her lab have been women, and many come from
                                        outside the US (Peru, China, Taiwan, Turkey). Her design is women-centered,
                                        creating novel beauty technologies that are mindful of the social, aesthetic,
                                        and cultural perspective of women, and she positions women as innovation
                                        drivers.</p>

                                    <p>Self-eSTEM provides interactive, culturally responsive STEM literacy, leadership,
                                        and technical training for girls and young women. Self-eSTEM focuses on building
                                        the skills, confidence, and resiliency needed for the STEM workforce of the
                                        future. The organization helps young women visualize themselves as STEM
                                        educators, engineers, programmers, and future industry leaders and mentors. The
                                        program model is designed to scale culturally-relevant content for educators and
                                        provide participant support at core developmental stages: childhood, emerging
                                        adulthood, and early career. The Self-eSTEM team is recruited from the community
                                        they serve and shares the experiences and background of their constituents.
                                        Since 2014, Self-eSTEM has served over 1,200 girls and helped them realize their
                                        education and career pursuits.</p>



                                    <p>Recently, Self-eSTEM launched a STEM Equity and Racial Justice Pledge as a direct
                                        response to our nation&#8217;s racial and gender challenges. It reflects a
                                        direct approach toward dismantling the systemic inequality and racism within
                                        STEM education and career pathways. The free program provides wraparound support
                                        and culturally relevant content to increase recruitment and retention of Black,
                                        Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations in the STEM talent pipeline.

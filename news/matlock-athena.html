                                <p>Vice Provost for Academic Personnel Teenie Matlock has been honored with the<a
                                        href="https://wit.berkeley.edu/athena-awards/"> Athena Award</a> for Academic
                                    Leadership by the Women in Technology Initiative at the University of California.
                                </p>
                                <p><a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/teenie-matlock">Matlock</a> was selected
                                    from a nationally competitive pool of candidates exemplifying high technical
                                    achievement along with support for women in technical fields and advancements for
                                    gender equity. The award notification stated, “Your leadership in linguistics and
                                    HCI [human-computer interaction] and your commitment to mentoring the next
                                    generation of researchers and faculty is inspiring.”</p>
                                <p>A cognitive scientist and linguist by training, Matlock researches how humans
                                    communicate and reason. She is known for early contributions to the field of
                                    human-computer interaction. For instance, she was issued a U.S. patent for rapid
                                    symbolic input in small, handheld devices as a result of her work at IBM Research in
                                    the late 1990s and early 2000s. She also did seminal work on how people think about
                                    and describe emerging technological developments, such as search engines when the
                                    Web was popularized.</p>
                                <p>“This award — appropriately named for a female deity of wisdom — is well deserved,”
                                    Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz said. “Professor Matlock’s contributions to her
                                    academic field, issues of diversity and inclusion, to the growth of human knowledge
                                    and to UC Merced have been invaluable. We enthusiastically join the Women in
                                    Technology Initiative in celebrating her career.”</p>

                                <p>Matlock has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles in fields such as cognitive
                                    science, psychology and human-computer interaction, and has served on many editorial
                                    boards for journals such as Cognitive Science, Metaphor and Thought, and
                                    Environmental
                                    Communication. She was associate editor for Cognitive Linguistics for a number of
                                    years.

                                <p>The Mariposa native joined UC Merced in 2004 as a founding faculty member and played
                                    integral roles in establishing the campus and the interdisciplinary <a
                                        href="https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/">Cognitive Information Sciences</a>

                                    and graduate group. She has held the McClatchy Chair in Communications for several
                                    years. A local with Indigenous roots, she is an active member of the American Indian
                                    Council of Mariposa County.</p>
                                <p>She was nominated for the Athena award by Professor Josh Viers, director of UC
                                    Merced’s
                                    branch of the <a href="https://citris.ucmerced.edu/">Center for Information
                                        Technology
                                        Research in the Interest of Society</a> (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute.</p>
                                <p>“Professor Matlock’s academic achievements at the intersection of human cognition,
                                    communications and technology are exemplary, but this award also recognizes her
                                    achievements in other dimensions,” Viers said. “Notably, she is a respected leader
                                    in
                                    diversity, equity and inclusion, and has positioned UC Merced for decades of
                                    successful
                                    faculty recruitment and retention. Furthermore, her local connections underscore the
                                    importance of building and maintaining a vibrant community beyond our campus.”</p>
                                <p>At UC Merced, Matlock has broken down academic hierarchies and spearheaded an effort
                                    to
                                    hire new faculty using innovative approaches to inclusivity, and initiated the
                                    institutional membership to the National Center for Faculty Development and
                                    Diversity.
                                    Her commitment to guiding women to succeed in technology is reflected through the
                                    expanded career opportunities she has opened for her mentees. Her mentees have been
                                    accepted into top graduate programs, landed tenure-track positions in leading
                                    research
                                    or teaching universities, and taken competitive research positions in tech companies
                                    such as Google.</p>
                                <p>"I’m honored to have been chosen for this award and pleased that CITRIS acknowledges
                                    UC
                                    women who excel in key areas of technological innovation and education, including
                                    academic leadership contributions," Matlock said.</p>
                                <p>Over the years, Matlock has received awards for distinction in research, teaching and
                                    mentoring. She has served on the governing board of the Cognitive Science Society,

                                        Presidents for $3.1 million for four UC campuses, LACA is intended to change the
                                        way California farms food in a way that is both environmentally friendly and
                                        boosts the economy. At its core, technology is a solution that will be carefully
                                        implemented to preserve jobs for a skilled workforce, leading to the vibrancy of
                                        the valley.

                                        region… If we can begin build more of an ecology and more productive path in the
                                        career pathway and a better environment to live people would want to stay here
                                        and we’d have a nice place here in the valley instead of having to crowd along
                                        to coast to get that fresh air.” Harmon said.</b>

                                        The reason is to adapt to the changes in California farm workforce and land
                                        availability. Traditional farming requires backbreaking intense labor, secure
                                        water resources, and extensive inputs like fertilizer to maintain crops.
                                        However, LACA hopes to solve most of these issues with the implementation of
                                        more sophisticated technology which will help manage farms sustainably. Sensors
                                        will be used to ensure the proper use of water. Robots will be used to help
                                        maintain plant health and communicate to farmers of any issues via a server. The
                                        technology will be given to farms of all sizes, big or small. Currently there in
                                        the works of trying to help smaller farms be able to afford this technology
                                        through various means like Co-Op to ensure they can reduce the amount of stress
                                        on the employees. This technology will not only will this help the farmer’s, but
                                        it will also create new jobs for students researching in STEM and provide jobs
                                        close to them.

                                        It is interesting how far technology has become where projects like this seem
                                        close to fruition. With this new way of agriculture, we hope to see a growth in
                                        the Central Valley creating a more sustainable, safe, and hopeful future for
                                        many low-income families. As a UC Merced student, in the heart of America’s most
                                        productive agricultural lands, I am excited to see the Central Valley will grow
                                        through thanks to LACA and the future of ag-tech holds.

                                        The team is working together to make this future possible, including amazing
                                        talent here from CITRIS at UC Merced. Leading with Harmon is Erin Hestir,
                                        Associate Professor in Civil & Environmental Engineering, and Colleen Naughton,
                                        Assistant Professor in Civil & Environmental Engineering. Stefano Carpin,
                                        Professor and founding chair in Computer Science and Engineering, is also
                                        helping as a researcher for the program. Joshua Viers, Professor of Civil &
                                        Environmental Engineering and Director of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC
                                        Merced, is also helping with research for LACA. These professors and the
                                        combined efforts of many others throughout the UC system hope to push ag-tech
                                        forward for a brighter future.

                                            YouTube</a>. For Harmon, the next step is for his team to write a
                                        trans-disciplinary writing piece encouraging policy makers to become interested
                                        in converging approaches to agriculture. The next Research Exchange is on The
                                        Charisma Machine: The Life, Death, and Legacy of One Laptop per Child with
                                        Morgan Ames. Make sure to register for this seminar to engage in a conversation

                                        reporting core elements of the USDA Sustainable Agricultural Systems project:
                                        Securing a Climate Resilient Water Future through Innovation in Measurement,
                                        Management, and Markets (SWIM). The coordinator will engage participating
                                        institutions, scientists, faculty, students and stakeholders to carry out
                                        project objectives. Primary duties include but are not limited to conducting
                                        best practices in team science (including collaboration planning), stakeholder
                                        engagement, community outreach and extension, project management and
                                        communication, as well as project evaluation and reporting. The coordinator will
                                        serve as the primary contact with research participants, sponsors, and
                                        collaborators, coordinating activities from initiation through close-out.

                                        The coordinator will work with the SWIM investigators to prepare reports,
                                        coordinate communication among scientists, interface with stakeholders and
                                        research partners, and planning meetings. This position will also work with the
                                        project team to write outreach and policy communications, and to develop
                                        outreach talks and materials based on research findings. Facilitation of

                                        instruction, and execution of the Climate Adaptation Science Academy.

                                        and press, and be of the highest quality. Facilitation of interdisciplinary
                                        collaboration on complex issues at the intersection of emerging science and
                                        transboundary policy is expected. Ability to work with a varied project team
                                        across multiple organizations and states through virtual engagement, as well as
                                        in person visits, is required. The coordinator will develop outreach products
                                        based on the SWIM research program, including research summaries, slides for
                                        talks, correspondence, and social media posts; as well as maintain content for
                                        the SWIM website and work with researchers to be sure intellectual materials are
                                        posted in a timely manner. Under direction, coordinator will take responsibility
                                        for preparing project reports and communications, assessing project status and
                                        needs, and facilitating overall project success.

                                <p>Professor and Vice Provost for Academic Personnel, and McClatchy Chair in
                                    Communications at University of California, Merced, Dr. Teenie Matlock was presented
                                    with the Athena Award for Academic Leadership, recognizing a lifetime of
                                    professional achievements. Athena Academic Leaders transform not only the lives of
                                    individuals by creating opportunities and by mentoring but shape the structures
                                    within the university system to afford equity and full participation for all. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Before joining the UC Merced – the tenth and newest campus of the University of
                                    California – as Founding Faculty in 2004, she was a Research Associate at Stanford
                                    University and worked at IBM Research. Her groundbreaking research was at the heart
                                    of human-computer interaction, where she pioneered and patented early digital input
                                    devices. She has since published over 100 peer-reviewed articles spanning cognitive
                                    science, psychology, linguistics and human-computer interaction. She has served on
                                    several editorial boards, including Cognitive Science and Environmental
                                    Communication, as well as serving on the governing board of the Cognitive Science
                                    Society and on the National Institute of Health’s Language and Communication study
                                    section.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Front and center, Mentoring, mentoring, mentoring.” Matlock’s remarks were filled
                                    with gratitude and focused on mentorship. Mentors of her past and how we can all be
                                    mentors today. She shared that as academic leadership means learning “how to build a
                                    good work culture, how to help others advance in their careers, and promoting
                                    diversity and inclusion.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    “I’m grateful to all the mentors I’ve had along the way,” Matlock said, starting
                                    with her first academic passion: playing trumpet. “Alberto Rodriguez would say,
                                    ‘Stop complaining, stop making excuses, and get to work.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    “My next mentor knew how to model good behavior that others would learn. She taught
                                    me how to give a good talk, be confident, and find a good research question.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, “many years later, J. Arthur Woodward, had been at UC over 25 years!
                                    There’s even a mentoring award named after him. He would ask, ‘What are you doing
                                    right now and why is it important to your own research and UC Merced?” Matlock
                                    attributes to the late Prof. Woodward her skill and dedication in creating new
                                    opportunities for others.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At UC Merced, “We’re seeing the benefits of mentoring. And we have lots to be proud
                                    of even though we’re young.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    She recommended “Get mentoring and be a mentor. And when you’re a mentor to others,
                                    look for diverse opportunities to mentor high school students and people early
                                    career. Mentor through showing and not just telling. And create a culture of
                                    mentoring. It’s important to technological innovation, sustainability, and health.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Through CITRIS Seed Funding, Associate Director of CITRIS UCM, Prof. Erin Hestir is
                                    co-leading an underrepresented minorities in STEM mentorship program, pairing
                                    graduate and undergraduate students from Berkeley, Davis and Merced and fostering
                                    shared values and growing near-peer networks across the UC system. Applications will
                                    open on the <a href=https://citris.ucmerced.edu/>citris.ucmerced.edu</a> website for the first cohort this summer.

                                <p>
                                    “I am humbled to present this award,” said Director of CITRIS UCM, Prof. Josh Viers.
                                    “In all the years I’ve been privileged to work with Teenie, I’ve observed her as an
                                    advocate and a leader in the academy, opening the gates for all to explore new
                                    frontiers.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    When Matlock began building UC Merced, she was returning home to the area. She
                                    serves in the Mariposa Community where she grew up. She has served as Vice Chair of
                                    the American Indian Council of Mariposa, and continues to engage in community
                                    activities with local Native American tribal groups, including her own, Southern
                                    Sierra Miwuk, to promote better educational opportunities and create bridges between
                                    the University of California and local indigenous peoples. Several years ago, she
                                    served on the systemwide President’s Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture and
                                    Inclusion. In addition to her scholarly and leadership activities, Matlock is a
                                    trumpet player, who performs with local jazz musicians.

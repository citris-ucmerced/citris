                          <h3>Our History</h3>
                          <p>
                            Since its creation in 2001 as one of four interdisciplinary institutes for
                            science and innovation at the University of California, CITRIS has demonstrated
                            an impressive return on investment by any measure. Through collaboration with
                            industry, government agencies, and international partners, CITRIS has enabled
                            innovations in nanotechnology, computer science, engineering, manufacturing,
                            social media, and other sectors.
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            In 2016, we recognize the Banatao Institute as an integral part of our
                            affiliated UC campuses. In alignment with the goals and values of Dado and Maria
                            Banatao, the Banatao Institute at CITRIS leverages University of California
                            expertise and IT solutions for the benefit of developing regions in the U.S. and
                            abroad. This widening sphere of influence is celebrated in our new name, CITRIS
                            and the Banatao Institute.

                          <h3>Our Campus</h3>
                          <p>
                            Established in 2005, University of California’s newest campus is also the first
                            American research university of the 21st Century. UC Merced has exceeded all
                            expectations: reaching R2 status faster than any other campus, achieving carbon
                            neutrality through investment in sustainability in every facet of life, and
                            rapidly growing to educate 9,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            By being a member of the San Joaquin Valley community and serving as a
                            representation of innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship in the heart of
                            the state of California, UC Merced strives to deliver solutions to local and
                            global problems.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            At UC Merced, learning goes beyond textbooks and classrooms. Students gain
                            hands-on experience through programs like Tech for Social Good and Innovate to
                            Grow , where they apply team-based leadership skills to real-world projects.

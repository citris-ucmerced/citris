            <h6>July 10-11, 2023</h6>

            CITRIS at UC Merced recently hosted an educational 2-day event, the
            2023 Bobcat Summer STEM Academy workshop, aimed at teaching high
            school students the ins and outs of programming self-flying drones.
            The event saw local high school students dive into the world of
            drones, exploring them from a technical perspective, while also
            exploring the real-world applications of drones through discussions,
            and simulated challenge scenarios. As part of the immersive
            experience, students were introduced to a curriculum that combined
            educational videos from familiar faces such as Mark Rober with fun
            and interactive activities. The activities included exploring 3D
            digital landscapes generated through drone photogrammetry and
            wildfire data analysis using satellite imagery. Each of these days
            ended with competitive challenges that tested the problem-solving
            skills of the students. The event had a focus on connecting the
            students’ technical drone skills to real-world scenarios, such as
            supply delivery during a fire, or a search and rescue mission. The
            problem-solving challenges would simulate these scenarios and
            require students to work in teams to accomplish their goals. As the
            CTIRIS team was getting ready to introduce the first challenge,
            Joshua Tapia, another instructor for CITRIS Education team, was
            excited to get going. "These challenges always bring a fun and
            engaging aspect to these events. The students really start to think
            outside of the box so they can beat their classmates in these
            friendly competitions." Kevin Lafreniere, an instructor on the
            CITRIS Education team, is interested in providing students with
            experiences they wouldn’t receive elsewhere. "It was fantastic
            seeing the interest from the students who had never flown or
            programmed a drone before," he said. "Many of these students
            wouldn’t consider careers utilizing drones because they haven’t even
            been exposed to it as an option, so I’m glad we’re able to provide
            these introductory experiences to them." Under the tutelage of the
            CITRIS Education team and support from CalTeach, the participants
            left the event with skills in manual flight routines and hands-on
            programming experience. The CITRIS team hopes the workshop will
            serve as a good foundation to progress the students’ interest in
            their education and aid in building their professional careers.

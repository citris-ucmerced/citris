                                Our diversity of programs addresses the most pressing needs for society. Technological
                                research and advances are delivering solutions from workforce development to
                                entrepreneurship. As an Institute of Science and Innovation at the University of
                                California, Merced, students make up the talent pool. Their unconventional innovation
                                yields results in creative education programs, like NexTech Robotics, and
                                entrepreneurial solutions.

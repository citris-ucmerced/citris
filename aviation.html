                                        Drones are in the process of revolutionizing data acquisition in the fields of 
                                        surveying, precision agriculture, construction, firefighting, and even accident
                                        forensics. They are also becoming an invaluable tool for cinematographers and 
                                        real estate services providing a low-cost and minimally intrusive alternative to 
                                        helicopters. Increasingly affordable and user-friendly drones have also opened 
                                        the field to a host of hobbyists and enthusiasts, opening up a burgeoning consumer

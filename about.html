                                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Since its creation in 2001 as one of four interdisciplinary institutes for science and innovation at the University of California,
                                        CITRIS has demonstrated an impressive return on investment by any measure. Through collaboration with industry, government agencies,
                                        and international partners, CITRIS has enabled innovations in nanotechnology, computer science, engineering, manufacturing, social media, 
                                        and other sectors.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In 2016, we recognize the Banatao Institute as an integral part of our affiliated UC campuses. In alignment with the goals and values of 
                                        Dado and Maria Banatao, the Banatao Institute at CITRIS leverages University of California expertise and IT solutions for the benefit of 
                                        developing regions in the U.S. and abroad. This widening sphere of influence is celebrated in our new name, “CITRIS and the Banatao Institute,”
                                        which debuted across the four campuses in Fall, 2016.

                                    <p>
                                        University of California’s newest campus. UC Merced continues to grow and serve a growing number of undergraduate and graduate
                                        students from the San Joaquin Valley, the state, the nation, and the world.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At UC Merced, learning goes well beyond textbooks and classrooms. With a rapidly rowing group of professors, researchers
                                        and postdoctoral students -- and even more rapidly growing student body -- UC Merced is poised to become a premier center for 
                                        new knowledge and critical breakthroughs beyond the Central Valley. Faculty members have access to world-class equipment,
                                        resources and a dedicated team of staff members to help them find funding or conduct their work.
                                    </p>

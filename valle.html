                                online, with hopes of eventual in-person activities. Activities include:

                                    ¡Valle! aims to foster diversity by increasing the accessibility of historically
                                    underrepresented students in STEM to research experiences, graduate school, and
                                    careers
                                    in technology. The program is extended, but not limited, to underrepresented
                                    minorities,
                                    women, first-generation college students, educationally or financially disadvantaged
                                    students, and students with disabilities. First and second year students are
                                    encouraged
                                    to apply. All applicants will be considered without regard to race or gender.

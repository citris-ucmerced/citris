                    This project develops of a transformative measurement and analytical tool to empower crop managers with data to make critical
                    decisions in the areas of water conservation and resources administration. The system consists of an
                    autonomous robotic platform equipped with sensors to ground-validate and enhance data provided by currently
                    available satellite systems. The robot autonomously navigates orchards collecting data "under the canopy"
                    that is otherwise not accessible from satellite or UAVs. Combining GPS, IMUs, and data coming from other
                    sensors, the robot accurately localizes itself in the field and builds an accurate map of the orchard
                    including a variety of information relevant to farmers, like presence of weeds, water leaks, and the
                    like. The onboard control software also ensures navigation through predetermined waypoints is safe, i.e.,
                    it implements obstacle avoidance and other features handling unforeseen circumstances. By combining and
                    validating satellite data with samples collected by an autonomous mobile sensor suite, a new class of
                    decision support systems can be developed. A fully functioning prototype of the proposed system is being
                    developed and tested on the field on multiple sites on the coast and in the Central Valley. In a time
                    of unprecedented, persistent drought, the proposed system has the potential to provide decision makers
                    with superior information to formulate sustainable management decisions.

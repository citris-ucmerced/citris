                    Groundwater is often over-looked by the average Californian, but is an important—albeit overused—local source of water throughout
                    the state. We currently use groundwater to close the gap between water demands and supplies from surface
                    water and inter-basin transfers. The objective of the project was to create a prototype for an end-to-end
                    Managed Aquifer Recharge Network (MAR-net) to help ensure a sustainable water supply for California.
                    This project will design and test a scalable system for maintaining a continuous account of our groundwater
                    resources. The project operated a prototypical MAR-net system in the Fresno Wastewater Treatment Plant
                    from 10/2010 through 12/2011. The system included three vertical soil monitoring stations with moisture,
                    temperature and salinity sensors, along with input flow metering, pressure transducers to measure pond
                    depth, and a weather station. Researchers are currently developing a model to describe the data.

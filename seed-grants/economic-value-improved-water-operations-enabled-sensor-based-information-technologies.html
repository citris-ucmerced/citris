                    Intelligent water information systems have the potential to provide precise measurement of snowpack and its condition from
                    day to day and particularly at critical points in the annual cycle. This information can be translated
                    into more accurate flow predications, presenting managers with the opportunity to improve the operation
                    of water infrastructure, including power generation, water supply, flood protection, and extend the functional
                    life of existing infrastructure. The goal of this project is to collect and analyze data on the economic
                    uses of water, understand the value of accuracy and timeliness of this information, and develop an improved
                    economic model that can assess the value of better information concerning the release of water from watersheds
                    above the river and reservoir system of California. Using sensor-based water management technologies,
                    the researchers will select an initial case study for the work, and include recommendations on how the
                    approach could be adapted.

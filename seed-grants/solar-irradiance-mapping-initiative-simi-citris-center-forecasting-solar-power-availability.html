                    Researchers at UC Merced designed and deployed 2 advanced solar observatories at the UC Merced and UC Davis campuses. In
                    order to implement an effective policy for solar power connectivity, the ability to forecast both short-
                    and long-term solar availability is paramount to utility companies and large-scale power generators.
                    CITRIS researchers utilized SIMI, a new concept that combines state-of-the-art satellite and radar image
                    processing with real-time data from ground solar stations to forecast solar power availability for the
                    various atmospheric conditions found around California. The web-based, near real-time information database
                    generated by SIMI is providing a direct estimate of both current and prospective power availability for
                    solar-based technologies in the state of California, as well as facilitating the deployment and connectivity
                    of solar power plants to the electric grid. The data will be used in decision-making regarding installation,
                    incentives and policies for solar technologies through the consideration of geographical and financial
                    constraints. One of the expected results from this initiative is a complete web-based GIS (Geographic
                    Information System) that facilitates the promotion and management of solar energy utilization in California.

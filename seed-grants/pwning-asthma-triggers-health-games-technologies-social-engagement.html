                    Games have a considerable history of introducing novel methods of thinking to communities through non-standard paths of transformation
                    and informal learning, especially concerning political conflict or uncertainty. This research is combining
                    three strategies: data mining, anthropological field work, and dramatization through game design. In
                    the game, researchers will correlate spatial maps of public records and scenarios of future climate change
                    and population growth with gameplay data to see if players develop effective strategies in a simulated
                    game environment to manage asthma triggers and optimize their healthcare. A beta version will be developed
                    in hmtl5 for adoption across multiple platforms and presented to focus groups in their two research sites
                    for evaluation. In particular, they are interested in seeing which game design approaches will lead to
                    intrinsic incentives for replay and adoption of the game as opposed to replay values driven by extrinsic
                    incentives such as access to media, free minutes, or gift certificates.

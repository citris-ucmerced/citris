                        In recent years, multiple works have been published showing how wireless sensor networks can be utilized to reduce the energy consumed by buildings. However, within the wireless sensor network community, there has been little research attempted to improve the quality of service for users. Instead, the aim has been simply to maintain, or in some cases, potentially decrease the quality of service in order to achieve greater efficiency.

 

                        The goal of this research is to increase the conditioning effectiveness of the HVAC system by incorporating participatory sensing and making adjustments to the building management systems in real time. Part of this goal is to show how participatory sensing is an effective tool for augmenting and maintaining the building management systems.

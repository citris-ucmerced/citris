                    Growing populations, agricultural land under cultivation, and stricter environmental regulations are pushing providers to
                    consider highly impaired water sources, such as wastewater, as potable water sources. However, the complex
                    nature of these water resources in terms of the concentrations and variety of contaminants is driving
                    a growing interest in membrane-based separation processes, due to the membrane’s ability to physically
                    remove these contaminants from the purified product stream. Membrane systems are typically controlled
                    using proprietary software and hardware, and require a skilled operator to monitor system performance.
                    These conditions limit system flexibility, and make the deployment of these systems in remote locations
                    difficult. In this project, we will develop membrane-based systems that couple electrically conducting
                    membranes with open-source hardware and software to produce a modular and autonomous water treatment
                    technology that can adjust operating conditions to respond to changes in feed water quality, as well
                    as initiate cleaning and maintenance operations without the need of human intervention. Here, the electrically
                    conducting membranes will serve multiple roles, including removal of contaminants, electrochemical sensors
                    for fouling monitoring, and self-cleaning surface through electrooxidation. Data from the membrane sensors,
                    as well as other sensors in the system (pressure, flow meters, conductivity) will be integrated in a
                    logical command framework that will control system parameters with the goal of optimizing system performance.
                    This seed project will form a foundation for our overall goal of developing autonomous water treatment
                    systems that can be rapidly deployed across multiple environments to produce potable water from any contaminated
                    water resource.

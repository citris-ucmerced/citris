                    The Center for Sierra Nevada Water Information System (CSNWIS) project resulted in a web portal which provides Sierra Nevada
                    satellite-snow-cover information, wireless-sensor-network data, and analyses which are useful for water
                    scientists, engineers, regulators, and managers. CSNWIS has created snow-covered-area datasets for 2000-2011
                    years which are currently available for viewing and download. Basin-scale analyses of snow products by
                    elevation are also available through the web portal. Using a modular, scalable design, the CSNWIS provides
                    a platform for archiving and serving water information. CSNWIS will continue to expand with more data
                    sets to provide information to users with research and operational forecasting interests. In the future,
                    projects may be expanded through collaboration with the California Resources Agency, hydroelectric companies,
                    and local water providers.

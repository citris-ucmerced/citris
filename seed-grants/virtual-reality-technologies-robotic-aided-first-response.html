                    Every day, robotic technologies save human lives in a variety of situations. Robots can go where it is unsafe for human beings
                    in first response situations, and they can be fully controlled by trained operators. Usually, the robot
                    operator experiences the situation being assessed only through a user interface combining a set of perceptual
                    cues provided by the robot sensors. Moreover, the operator interacts with the robot using control devices
                    similar to those commonly used to control virtual reality artifacts, like video game characters or synthetic
                    avatars operating in cyberspace. Thanks to a synergy between the robotics group at UC Merced and the
                    Merced Sheriff Office SWAT team, the goal of this project is to explore how this interplay between virtual
                    reality and robotics can lead to the development of better training tools for first responders. A unique
                    feature of this project is the partnership between end-users already using tactical robots and a university
                    research team with multi-year experience in the field of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) robots.

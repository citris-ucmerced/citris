                    Respiratory epithelial cells, which form the lining of the airway system, provide our bodies its first line of defense against
                    many harmful inhaled agents including dusts, air pollutants, chemicals and microbes, in addition to many
                    biological and chemical agents. CITRIS researchers aimed to design and develop small-scale biosensors
                    to incorporate airway epithelial cells to detect airborne pollutants through microfluidic devices. These
                    devices detect harmful airborne agents, which, when integrated into a wireless system, would enable a
                    detection system linked into a real-time communications network. These sensor communications networks
                    could provide a much needed early warning system for sensitive areas, such as in large population centers
                    or areas with polluted air. This project also represents a unique opportunity to apply sensor network
                    technology to monitor the air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, which ranks amongst the most polluted
                    air basins in the US and has been designated by EPA as a “nonattainment” area. However, biosensors for
                    nanoparticles are still under-developed. This project aims to develop a highly sensitive and potential
                    portable whole cell-based biosensor with the capability to detect the presence of a wide-variety of nanoparticles
                    for air quality control.

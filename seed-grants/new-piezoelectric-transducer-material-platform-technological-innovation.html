                    This CITRIS research project was primarily focused on synthesizing a new type of a photo-response polymer system. Polymers’
                    responsive behaviors, response frequency, amplitude, force generated and the number of cycles before
                    failure as a function of light and heat stimulations will be characterized. Energy and force transduction
                    efficiency include converting thermal energy into electricity and transforming electrical “force” to
                    mechanical displacement will be investigated. Without any conventional photosensitive moieties, this
                    new type of polymer film can directly convert photon energy into mechanical energy reliably and can also
                    generate electricity when it is attached to a PVDF film. Unlike azobenzene-based conventional photomechanical
                    polymer systems, this new material has higher photon transmission and thus offers great potential to
                    generate higher mechanical actuation.

                    The senior population in the U.S. will grow to 72 million by 2030, representing 20% of the total U.S. population. As a result,
                    there is a growing need for computer and information technology to improve senior citizen quality of
                    living while reducing the overall cost of health care. CITRIS researchers developed a mobile sensor platform
                    for use in monitoring, home security, and personal assistance using relatively inexpensive hardware.
                    Using a research version of Roomba, the iRobot Create platform, researchers found a solution that would
                    be able to monitor a senior without disruption of daily activities while remaining relatively inexpensive.
                    However, using inexpensive components also created a challenge for researchers. Ultimately, the main
                    objective of this project is to develop robust inference algorithms and multi-robot coordination methods
                    to overcome the problems arising from using inexpensive hardware.

                    With the predicted prevalence of the SmartGrid—a wireless sensor network derived from a number of small devices, demand will
                    grow for devices that can: economically perform measurement and control tasks to ensure the stability
                    of the larger grids of electrical energy producers and consumers, as well as permit the transmission
                    of energy from renewable energy sources whose outputs tend to be more variable. The goal of this seed
                    project is to establish the feasibility of electromechanically conditioning the energy obtained from
                    energized conductors to power wireless electrical sensors in SmartGrid applications. Wireless sensor
                    networks are becoming commonplace: for example, companies currently link miniature wireless radios together
                    with sensors to measure and report data in refineries and manufacturing plants. This research is focused
                    on novel devices that will efficiently obtain and store electrical energy scavenged from energized conductors
                    such as common electrical cords and higher voltage power distribution and transmission lines and circuit
                    components.

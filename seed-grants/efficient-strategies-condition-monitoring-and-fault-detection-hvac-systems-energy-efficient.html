                    Large and complex HVAC systems are naturally difficult to monitor. Indeed, one of the outcomes of this research was the development
                    of a top-down strategy for fault detection, which discovered several faults in the Science and Engineering
                    building. The objective of this project is to develop methods for effective monitoring of system conditions
                    and fault detection of large and complex HVAC systems. This project contributes to the development of
                    intelligent control, monitoring, and fault detection technologies that are integral part of energy-efficient
                    carbon-neutral buildings. The key outcome of the project includes methods for spatial and temporal partition
                    of large complex HVAC systems, development of pre-processing algorithms to discover new features in the
                    monitored data set, selection of effective methods for HVAC monitoring and fault detection, and finally
                    establishment of thresholds for various faults.

                    The heritage site of Bodie is a popular California State Historic Park that encompasses 2,900-acre landscape of historic
                    buildings, objects, California Natives archaeological remains, and landforms associated with mining-related
                    activities. Bodie is at risk of being lost due to wildfires and lack of funding for conservation. Having
                    the capacity to call public attention to critical social issues and build constituencies, mobile apps
                    and social media are a potential solution to this problem.

                    Bodie Digital Community – Connect with your Past is an augmented reality application for mobile devices created in collaboration
                    with California State Parks. This app promotes public engagement in heritage preservation, fosters connection
                    among visitors, and generates useful data that improve the management and preservation of California
                    natural and cultural resources.

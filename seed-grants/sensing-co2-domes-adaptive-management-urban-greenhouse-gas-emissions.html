                    Urbanized regions are responsible for a disproportionately large percentage (30-40%) of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas
                    emissions. While a growing number of studies have addressed urban and suburban CO2 fluxes, current experimental
                    techniques are not robust with respect to policy or scientific objectives. Thus, researchers explored
                    a novel technique for surface flux partitioning based on coupled atmospheric models and continuous sensor-network
                    observation of ambient CO2 and carbonyl sulfide. The goal of the project was to create proof of concept
                    results and a science plan for developing, deploying, and assessing a new COS sensor and atmospheric
                    modeling strategy for the application of greenhouse gas emissions measurement at the city scale. Researchers
                    initiated the implementation of a unique top-down constraint on an urban GHG budget using the simultaneous
                    analysis of atmospheric CO2 and carbonyl sulfide.

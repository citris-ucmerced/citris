                    This research focuses on intelligent systems that can be used to train and assist people in preparation for or during complex
                    and difficult situations. Two of its main sub-projects include wireless based localization and design
                    of human-like motion interfaces. Intelligent systems must achieve the ability to seamlessly cooperate
                    with humans in order to be successfully integrated into society. These systems can be fully autonomous,
                    remotely operated, or directly controlled. When put in the context of a disaster framework where human-robot
                    interfaces are key for achieving effective robot-operator and robot-victim interactions, the need for
                    effective cooperation becomes especially apparent. There are two ways systems can be designed: carefully
                    engineered to perform simple functionalities or programmed with generalized concepts to be reused under
                    a variety of contexts.

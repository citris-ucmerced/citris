                    Transdermal patches are the least invasive of available drug delivery techniques. Since their approval for clinical use in
                    transdermal patches have become ideal carriers for a variety of drugs. Although transdermal patches are
                    very promising, even wider application of this drug-delivery technique is still hindered by two main
                    factors: the limited permeability of the human skin and the absence of a cheap, reliable and versatile
                    patch that can release well-controlled dosages of a variety of drugs at precise time intervals over a
                    long period. This project aims to design a smart controllable membrane, which combines the simplicity
                    of a membrane based patch with the precise drug delivery of a complex micro-machine based system. This
                    has the potential to decrease the cost and increase the applicability of transdermal delivery. The aim
                    of the research is to investigate whether a modeling approach encompassing two complementary simulation
                    techniques in an integrated framework can be used to design a smart membrane. Specifically, the goal
                    of the proposed research is to investigate how porous membrane surface features could be rationally designed
                    for precise flow control.

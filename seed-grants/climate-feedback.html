                    Climate Feedback (http://climatefeedback.org) brings the expertise of scientists to subject influential media articles about
                    climate change to a process akin to peer-review. Using a new web-annotation tool, Hypothesis, scientists
                    provide their analyses layered directly onto original text, validating science-based content, highlighting
                    inaccuracies, or adding context. Each article evaluation features a summary in clear language for lay
                    readers and a credibility rating issued by scientists. This rating provides an easy to share, objective
                    and transparent assessment of the scientific credibility of a news source. Over the last 6 months, Climate
                    Feedback's network of contributors has grown to 70+ PhD scientists who have completed evaluations of
                    a dozen articles from The Wall Street Journal, Mashable, CNN, The New York Times, Pope Francis’ Encyclical
                    and more. One of the evaluations has led a major British news outlet (The Telegraph) to issue an official
                    correction and heavily modify its article. Climate Feedback works towards creating a comprehensive database
                    on the scientific trustworthiness of major climate change reporting that would allow anyone to easily
                    compare and contrast the credibility of different news sources and identify sources of information they
                    can trust. This approach has the potential to provide a strong incentive for news sources to ensure that
                    their reporting is scientifically accurate. Climate Feedback has developed an open-source website template
                    that enables linking news articles to relevant experts, organizing contributors and quickly publishing
                    a response. The hope is to inspire others to reuse this work and build on this approach in other fields
                    of science.

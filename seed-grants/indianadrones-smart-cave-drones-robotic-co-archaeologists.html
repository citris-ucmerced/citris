                    The goal of this CITRIS seed project is to advance technological development in mapping archaeological cave sites using low-cost
                    drones for cave exploration as robotic "co-archaeologists."Using video imagery collected by drones, we
                    plan to produce high resolution, accurate, 3D images with smart lighting control. This is a major advance
                    in archaeological practice, enabling us to quickly map these complex spaces to that we may conduct 3D
                    analyses. Our project will potentially forever change the way that future cave archaeology is done.

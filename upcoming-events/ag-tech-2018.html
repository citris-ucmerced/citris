    AgFoodTech Week aims to promote the awareness of current technologies within 
    agriculture and the food processing industry and future issues that can be 
    addressed between the collaboration of industry, academic, and agricultural leaders.
    <br>
    The week will kick off on March 1st, 2019 with a Frontiers in Technology Seminar by 
    Dr. Matthew Lange from the University of California, Davis, titled, “A New Discipline 
    for a New Technology: Food Information and the Internet of Food”. This will be followed 
    by HackMerced, an annual 36-hour hackathon hosted at the UC Merced, where developers 
    and designers can work together to solve pressing agricultural technology issues from 
    March 1st to March 3rd. On March 5th, students can network with different companies within 
    the agricultural industry and the internship and job opportunities they offer at the 
    Career & Internship Fair on March 5th. On March 7th, CITRIS will host the AgFoodTech 
    Executive Roundtable, to solicit feedback from key regional stakeholders engaged in 
    agricultural production and food processing and to provide UC Merced administration 
    and faculty about the future direction of their industries, research and training 
    needs, and trends in technologies. AgFoodTech Week will conclude with the Unmanned 
    Aircraft Systems Safety Course co-hosted by CITRIS and the University of California 
    Extension on March 8th.

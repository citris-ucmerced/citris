                                        Drones are in the process of revolutionizing data acquisition in the fields of 
                                        surveying, precision agriculture, construction, firefighting, and even accident
                                        forensics. They are also becoming an invaluable tool for cinematographers and 
                                        real estate services providing a low-cost and minimally intrusive alternative to

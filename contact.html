                                    CITRIS UCM is built from the emergent networks of collaborative researchers. The
                                    program is led by Dr. Joshua Viers. Associate Director Dr. Erin Hestir leads the
                                    EDGE in Tech initiative at UCM. Program Director Dr. Leigh Bernacchi serves to
                                    connect community, industry, and academic partners.

                                    The work would not be possible without the creativity, skill, and dedication of a
                                    team of UC Merced students.

    <p>
        The Aging in a Digital World conference is focused on identifying gaps 
        in research, technology, and policy that are delaying the adoption of 
        innovations to support aging in a digital world. We seek poster abstracts
        on topics related to the conferenceâ€™s subject matter of aging, technology,
        and health care policy research.

    Auto use is growing globally, along with the environmental and societal problems it generates, climate change most notably.
    A recent slowdown in the growth in vehicle-miles-traveled in the U.S. and Europe, however, has raised hopes that some
    parts of the world may have reached “peak driving.” What is behind this recent slowdown, and is it a true or temporary
    peak? Answering these questions requires a close look at the behavior underlying these trends and at the numerous economic,
    technological, and cultural changes that are driving changes in travel behavior. In this presentation, I share findings
    from studies from UC Davis and elsewhere on some of the critical changes that are shaping the future of travel demand
    Dr. Susan Handy is Chair of the Department of Environmental Science and Policy and the Director of the National Center
    for Sustainable Transportation at the University of California, Davis. She is internationally known for her research
    on the relationships between transportation and land use, particularly the impact of neighborhood design on travel behavior.
    Her current work focuses on bicycling as a mode of transportation and on strategies for reducing automobile dependence.

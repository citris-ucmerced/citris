    Dr. Ashok Gadgil has a doctorate in physics from UC Berkeley. He is Director of the Environmental Energy Technologies Division
    of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley. He has
    substantial experience in technical, economic, and policy research on energy efficiency and its implementation — particularly
    in developing countries. For example, the utility-sponsored compact fluorescent lamp leasing programs that he pioneered
    are being successfully implemented by utilities in several east-European and developing countries. He has several patents
    and inventions to his credit, among them the “UV Waterworks,” a technology to inexpensively disinfect drinking water
    in the developing countries, for which he received the Discover Award in 1996 for the most significant environmental
    invention of the year, as well as the Popular Science award for “Best of What is New – 1996″. In recent years, he has
    worked on ways to inexpensively remove arsenic from Bangladesh drinking water, and on fuel-efficient stoves for Darfur.

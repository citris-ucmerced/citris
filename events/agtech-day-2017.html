        CITRIS, the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society, and University Extension are proud to invite you to the 2nd Annual CITRIS Agricultural Technology Fair on March 8, 2017. This event takes place during UC Merced’s Research Week, a celebration of the significant and innovative work being conducted at the university.

        CITRIS is focused on translating ideas into real-world applications in the many sectors that affect the lives of all Californians, from data analytics, to renewable energy and smart transportation, to new discoveries in water information management. It is our belief that this showcase of emerging technologies, backed by cutting-edge research and entrepreneurial innovation, will place the San Joaquin Valley on the map as a place for new ideas and a transformative impact in the agricultural technology sector.
        
        We look forward to working with you as we expand the impact of world class research in the San Joaquin Valley.

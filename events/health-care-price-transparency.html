    Join us for a talk by Chris Whaley, Analytics Associate, Castlight Health. Chris is in the third year of his PhD in health
    economics at UC Berkeley. His main research interests are patient decision making and provider choice. Prior to Berkeley,
    he worked for the Health Economics group at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica. He received his undergrad degree in
    economics from the University of Chicago in 2008. Abstract: Price variation for medical services has been well documented
    and recent federal, state, and private initiatives have focused on increasing price transparency in health care in hopes
    of reducing health care costs. However, the effect of federal and state initiatives remains unclear while the effect
    of private tools has not been studied. Castlight Health offers a novel price transparency platform that allows health
    care consumers easy access to personalized price and quality information. This talk provides an overview of health care
    price transparency, the mechanics of Castlight's efforts to increase health care consumerism, and the role of "big data"
    in health care. Preliminary results find that use of Castlight¹s price transparency platform was associated with lower
    prices for common medical procedures.

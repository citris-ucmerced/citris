    Bayes Impact's is a non-profit whose mission is to use data science to do good on a large scale. Our work at the intersection
    of technology and policy has led us to work with governments and NGOs around the world in areas spanning health, social
    services, and international development. How did the real world change or confirm our views? I will talk about our experiences
    developing Bayes Impact, from the original motivation behind the project to the challenges we faced along the way, mistakes
    we made and successes we had, and how our vision has evolved in return.

    This talk describes a new architecture for distributed flash flood and traffic monitoring in cities using combined Eulerian
    and Lagrangian sensing. Unlike current traffic sensor networks, the architecture maintains user privacy by using a distributed
    computing approach. In this system, probe vehicles broadcast speed data to local nodes, which estimate vehicles location.
    Fixed sensors also measure traffic parameters, and all traffic data is forwarded to local coordinator nodes. Using the
    classical LWR traffic flow model, we show that the traffic reconstruction problem results in a set of MILPs, which can
    be efficiently solved by all nodes using distributed computing, the coordinator node supervising all computations. With
    this approach, user privacy is maintained, in the sense that no vehicle track data is forwarded beyond the radio range
    of the node cluster. Biography: Christian Claudel is an assistant professor of Electrical Engineering and Mechanical
    engineering at KAUST. He received the PhD degree in EECS from UC Berkeley in 2010, and the Ms degree in Plasma Physics
    from Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon in 2004. He received the Leon Chua Award from UC Berkeley in 2010 for his work
    on Mobile Millennium. His research interests include control and estimation of distributed parameter systems, wireless
    sensor networks and environmental sensing systems

    In this lecture, I will argue that a century of lived experience in the political economy of expansive capitalism in the
    rich countries of the world has led to a habituation to not only high levels of materials and resources used in everyday
    practices, but to a habituation to expansion itself. Neither energy and climate change theorists nor policy makers have
    engaged with the culture of capitalism. Mainstream policy is putting all of its effort into making sustainability happen
    within an expansionist frame. The record shows that several decades of efforts to reduce energy use and carbon emissions
    in growth economics such as those of the OECD countries have not been successful, while at the same time rapidly expanding
    economies elsewhere are using energy and emitting carbon in step with their economic growth. Using examples from home
    energy, transport and food, I will articulate the relationship between the politics of expansion and the formation of
    high-energy habits at the level of family and household. It will elaborate a theory of habits and reflect on the politics
    of unlocking low energy habits. A transformative policy will entail a reassessment of a macro-economic framing which
    assumes that growth and markets will do the strategic restructuring for us. It will involve support for emerging community-based
    actions around the world, both real and virtual, that are engaged forming collaborative practices and reestablishing
    shared ownership.

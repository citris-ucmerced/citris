    The Core of a Game: This talk discusses how games are crafted from the inside out, first focusing on a core and its core
    loop, and then expanding upon it with a feature set which makes the core stronger. Various example of design and development
    are offered along with a discussion on the current state of the game industry. Brenda Romero is the Program Director
    for the UC Santa Cruz Master's in Games + Playable Media and the CEO and Co-Founder of Loot Drop, game studio focused
    on fun.

    One of the recent research thrusts in my research group aims at developing a novel transparent cranial implant (“window”)
    that enables life-long, non-invasive delivery and/or collection of laser light into and from shallow and deep brain tissue
    on demand. Such an implant would allow for real-time and highly precise visualization and treatment of diverse brain
    pathologies, such as those resulting from traumatic brain injury or brain tumors, without the need of highly-invasive
    craniotomies or trepanation procedures. The window could be permanently covered with native scalp that can be rendered
    temporarily transparent on demand in a minimally-invasive manner. In collaboration with other research groups at UCR,
    an YSZ implant has been successfully fabricated with current-activated powder-assisted densification (CAPAD) processing
    method. A summary of these results as well as ongoing and future studies pertaining to this research thrust will be presented.
    Guillermo Aguilar joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of California Riverside, where he was
    promoted to Associate Professor in 2007, Full Professor in 2012 and since 2013 serves as the Department Chair. His current
    research interests include cryogen spray cooling, laser-tissue interactions, biomedical optics and medical lasers.

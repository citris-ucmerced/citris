    In 2014 California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) to address impacts associated groundwater pumping.
    This act mandates that areas that depend upon groundwater achieve sustainability by 2040. To meet the requirements of
    this act there will need to be a net reduction in groundwater overdraft of more than 2 million acre-feet per year. The
    social, economic and environmental consequences—intended or otherwise—of this change in water policy are vast. Opportunities
    to augment supplies are limited, although new storage, conveyance and groundwater recharge will help. In areas connected
    to the state’s water supply systems—particularly the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project--there
    will be increased pressure to transfer water. This will impact on-going efforts to address water supply reliability and
    ecosystem issues in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. However, sustainability will be achieved principally though reductions
    in demand. In the San Joaquin Valley—the region accounting for most overdraft—this will involve permanent or temporary
    fallowing of hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland, with consequences for the farm economy in the valley and rural
    communities dependent upon farm labor. There will also be wide ranging environmental consequences. How land is fallowed,
    including the quality of soils, will affect air quality, water quality and terrestrial habitat. Demand reduction will
    also increase conflicts over the use of surface water to support aquatic habitat and wetlands as well as groundwater-dependent
    ecosystems. California needs to take a comprehensive look at what it is going to take to achieve groundwater sustainability
    and develop pathways that minimize or mitigate unwanted effects. Biography Dr. Jeffrey Mount is a Senior Fellow with
    the Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center. His work at the Public Policy Institute of California
    focuses on bringing together multidisciplinary teams of researchers to develop novel solutions to water problems, particularly
    in California. He is the Founding Director of the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences and Professor Emeritus in the
    Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. During his long career Dr. Mount has published widely on the science and
    management of rivers, including his awardwinning book, California Rivers and Streams (UC Press). He is co-author of the
    recent synthesis Managing California’s Water: From Conflict to Reconciliation (PPIC). If you are not an ES graduate seminar

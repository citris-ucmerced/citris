    To help increase the chances for successful innovation in the marketplace, this talk will expand beyond the problems typically
    discussed with open innovation and offer a new entrepreneurial investment model. The discussion reviews and critiques
    ten existing models of creating and turning innovations into new companies. For instance, innovation cultures exist in
    self-funded and venture-funded entrepreneurial organizations, in universities, and in large research labs. What are the
    various strengths and weaknesses of the existing models for innovation development? We will discuss ways that startups
    are often cobbled by limited perspective and resources. They can be limited by current trends in funding, limitations
    of team experience, technology concerns, and inadequate market information. At academic institutions, opportunities for
    taking innovations forward can be limited by the academic stance and by project continuity. And large companies tend
    to be limited by the expectations of product managers and by current revenue streams. In consideration of the problems
    of current innovation models, the presentation will offer a model called a “generator fund”: a new entrepreneurial investment
    model which can increase innovation's chances for success. A generator fund starts with an internal team of experienced
    inventors and researchers who choose several technology ideas to develop into prototypes and test for performance. Two
    to four times a year, a board then selects a prototype for an “excubate” -- a process in which prototype products are
    shared with aspiring entrepreneurs in a series of mentored competitions designed to develop teams, test the market, and
    improve the prototypes’ technology. The three-step incented competition also provides opportunities to develop customers
    and create a plan to attract acquisition or venture funding. Ted Selker manages Research on Accessible Voting at University
    of California Berkeley Ted spent 5 years as director of Considerate Systems research at Carnegie Mellon University Silicon
    Valley. He was also responsible for developing the campus’s research mission, teaching HCI, Android product design, and
    research concerning disabilities technology development for voting. He is well known as a creator and tester of new scenarios
    for working with computing systems and has a design practice that includes speaking engagements, innovation workshops
    and engagements in large companies and engagements in startups. He is CTO of Foldimate for which he made a shirt-folding
    robot this year. Ted spent ten years as an associate Professor at the MIT Media Laboratory where he created the Context
    Aware Computing group, co-directed the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, and directed a CI/IDI: kitchen of the future/
    product design of the future project. His work is noted for creating demonstrations of a more considerate world in which
    intentions are recognized and respected in complex domains, such as kitchens, cars, on phones and in email. Ted’s work
    takes the form of prototyping concept products supported by cognitive science research. His successes at targeted product
    creation and enhancement earned him the role of IBM Fellow and director of User Systems Ergonomics Research. He has also
    served as a consulting professor at Stanford University, taught at Hampshire, University of Massachusetts at Amherst
    and Brown Universities and worked at Xerox PARC and Atari Research Labs. Ted's innovation has been responsible for profitable
    and award winning products ranging from notebook computers to operating systems. For example, his design of the TrackPoint
    in-keyboard pointing device is used in many notebook computers; his visualizations have made impacts ranging from improving
    the performance of the PowerPC to usability OS/2 ThinkPad setup to Google maps, his adaptive help system has been the
    basis of products as well. Ted’s work has resulted in numerous awards, patents, and papers and has often been featured
    in the press. Ted was co-recipient of the Computer Science Policy Leader Award for Scientific American 50 in 2004, the
    American Association for People with Disabilities Thomas Paine Award for his work on voting technology in 2006 and the
    Telluride Tech fest award in 2008.</p>

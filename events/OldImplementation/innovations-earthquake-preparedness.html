    No one likes to be reminded that there’s a 99.7% chance that California will experience a major earthquake in the next 30
    years. But a little preparedness can go a long way and a new mobile-friendly website called QuakeCAFE can help. We invite
    you to join us for a public forum where we will discuss the data and lessons learned from QuakeCAFE followed by a panel
    discussion on new innovations for earthquake early warning, preparedness, and response. Launched by the CITRIS Connected
    Communities Initiative at UC Berkeley in collaboration with the Office of the Lt. Governor of California, QuakeCAFE provides
    Californians with a powerful tool that allows them to quickly and easily assess their level of preparedness, and compare
    their readiness for the Big One with others across the state. It works on all screens and takes only a minute to complete:
    http://quakecafe.org Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Prof. Ken Goldberg and the QuakeCAFE team will be joined by Profs. Richard
    Allen and Peggy Hellweg from the UC Berkeley Seismological Lab; Dr. Ross Stein, co-founder of Temblor, a startup that
    enables people to learn their seismic hazard and how to reduce their risk; and Amina Assefa, Manager of the Office of
    Emergency Management, UC Berkeley.

    Carla Peterman, Commissioner, California Public Utilities Commission, will speak about how California energy policy supports
    an ambitious transition from conventional fossil generation to renewable and other clean resources. Low-carbon, variable
    and distributed generation provide many benefits to the state, but also present new circumstances for our traditional
    energy integration and reliability tools to respond to. Some of the resources that California is pursuing to manage this
    ramp are demand response, generation diversity, fast response natural gas plants, and energy storage. This talk will
    discuss the tools and analytics the California Public Utilities Commission and the state are pursing to address integration
    and promote flexible resources. In particular, recent developments in energy storage and demand response, and the potential
    role for electric vehicles to provide these services, will be highlighted.

  <p>
    This talk focuses on a cognitive computing approach to handle common problems within utilities, concentrating on utility
    operations and exploring the concept of using cognitive models and the underlying technologies that support it. I will
    discuss such topics as big data, analytics, sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT), along with the cognitive modeling
    schema.In addition, I will present examples of business problems that could utilize cognitive computing capabilities,
    along with issues and challenges to this type of approach. Chris Couper is an IBM Distinguished Engineer with over thirty
    years of industry and IT experience. He currently works on IBM’s smarter planet opportunities related to risk analytics

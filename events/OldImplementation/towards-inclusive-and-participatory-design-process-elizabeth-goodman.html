  <p>
    Elizabeth Goodman is a design researcher at 18F. She studies how people live to design and develop tools that support them.
    Over the course of a project, she might translate relevant scholarly work into action; break down large, complicated
    questions into smaller projects to prioritize them; map the cultural and social landscapes that new products and services
    will inhabit; and facilitate the participation of future users and other project constituencies in decision-making. Goodman
    has a PhD from UC Berkeley’s School of Information Sciences. She has taught classes at UC Berkeley and the San Francisco
    Art Institute, is the author of two books and also speaks and leads workshops at a variety of conferences.

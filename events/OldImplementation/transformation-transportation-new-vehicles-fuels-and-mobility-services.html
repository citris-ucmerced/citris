    Passenger transportation was arguably the least innovative sector in our society over the past 80 years. Passenger travel
    has devolved into a monoculture where the single occupant vehicle dominates all other surface modes. We are now on the
    threshold of radical change. New mobility services such as Uber and Lyft, new propulsion technologies using electricity
    and hydrogen, and increasing vehicle automation could transform how we travel, with the potential for a much smaller
    resource and environmental footprint. Dr. Daniel Sperling is Professor of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science
    and Policy, and founding Director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis (ITS-Davis).
    He has led ITS-Davis to international prominence by building strong partnerships with industry, government, and the environmental
    community, integrating interdisciplinary research and education programs, and connecting research with public outreach
    and education.

        The CITRIS Seed Funding Program invites Principal Investigators at UC Berkeley, UC Davis,
         UC Davis Health, UC Merced, and UC Santa Cruz to apply for seed funding that advances 
         CITRIS and the Banatao Institute's research thrusts, strengthens UC campus connections,
        and drives novel technology applications.

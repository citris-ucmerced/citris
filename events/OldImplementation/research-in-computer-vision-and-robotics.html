    In this research seminar, Professor Takeo Kanade from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University will touch upon
    highlights of various research and development in which he was involved in the area of computer vision and robotics.
    A few candidates for topics that he will cover include face image analysis, vision-based autonomous robots, EyeVision,
    biological live cell tracking, and smart headlight. While presenting their technical contents, Kanade will try to sprinkle
    his anecdotal experiences, strategies, and philosophy in research including his research motto, “think like an amateur,
    do as an expert”, which he hopes the audience finds interesting and useful in order for them to make their research and
    development fun and productive.

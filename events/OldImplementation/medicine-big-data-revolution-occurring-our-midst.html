    Human beings are big data. Analogous to computer code, human beings are uniquely defined by the information content held
    within the body and more specifically, how that information is interconnected. As medical data continues to explode and
    become increasingly digital, the vast amount of information that is able to be collected presents significant opportunities
    to improve the nature of medicine and care. In short, the influx of patient data and decoded genetics has turned modern
    medical issues into Big Data problems. In the future, the Hippocratic Oath will require doctors to take this genetic
    variability into account, which poses a number of ethical questions and concerns. This discussion aims to dissect the
    revolution of personalized medicine, and more specifically how big data and our decoded genomics will change the nature
    of disease, healthcare diagnoses, treatment, and regulation. Biography: Ted Driscoll is a Partner in Digital Healthcare

    Chancellor Dorothy Leland of the University of California, Merced cordially invites you to the Vital and Alice Pellissier
    Family Distinguished Speaker Series presenting Jay Famiglietti, Professor of Earth System Science at the University of
    California, Irvine, “Satellite Observations of the Epic California Drought: Realities of 21st Century Water Sustainability”
    Dr. Jay Famiglietti Jay Famiglietti is a hydrologist and a professor of Earth System Science at the University of California,
    Irvine (UCI), where he was Founding Director of the UC Center of Hydrologic Modeling. He is currently serving as the
    Senior Water Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology; and he was appointed
    to the California State Water Boards (Region 8) by Governor Jerry Brown. Famiglietti’s research group uses satellites
    and develops advanced computer models to track how freshwater availability is changing in California, the western U.
    S. and around the globe. A fellow of the American Geophysical Union and of the Geological Society of America, he is a
    frequent speaker, an avid writer and he is committed to science communication. Professor Famiglietti is a regular advisor
    to state and federal government officials on water availability and water security issues, and his work is often featured
    in the international news media. As California endures its fourth year of epic drought, questions regarding the future
    of water sustainability are inevitable. Snowpack, soil moisture, streamflow, reservoir and groundwater levels are all
    at record lows. Mandatory water restrictions have been implemented, statewide fines for wasting water have been authorized,
    and billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost. When will it all end? Will it end at all? Will
    El Niño come to the rescue? In this talk Professor Famiglietti will share the sobering, statewide picture that satellites
    are revealing and discuss future avenues for sustainability in both urban and agricultural regions.

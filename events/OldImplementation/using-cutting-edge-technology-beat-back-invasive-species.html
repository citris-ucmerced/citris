    UC Davis is hosting a one-day science symposium on Invasive Aquatic Vegetation in the delta. Experts will explore new developments
    in surveillance and monitoring of aquatic vegetation to facilitate management and control, advances in knowledge that
    could lead to better management and control practices, and advances in risk assessment and reduction. Tentative Schedule:

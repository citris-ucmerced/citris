    The demand-side of electricity markets has an important role to play in advancing our progress towards cleaner and more reliable
    electric power systems. Across the country, and across the world, governments areimplementing policies designed to improve
    demand-side energy efficiency and enable more efficient electricity demand-response. Measuring the impacts and relative
    effectiveness of these programs is complicated because it requires a credible “counterfactual” estimate of the energyconsumption
    patterns that would have manifest absent these policies. This talk will discuss how randomized field experiments are
    being used to evaluate the impacts of energy efficiency and demand response programs. In particular, ongoing work that
    evaluates residential energyefficiency retrofits, time varying electricity pricing, and appliance upgrades in a rural
    electrification context, will be highlighted. Strengths and limitations of experimental approaches to evaluating these
    demand-side interventions will be discussed. Meredith Fowlie is an Associate Professor in the Department of Agricultural
    and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley

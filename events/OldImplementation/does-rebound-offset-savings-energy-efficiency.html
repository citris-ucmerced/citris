    <h2>Does Rebound Offset The Savings From Energy Efficiency</h2>

  <p>
    Improving the efficiency with which we use energy is often said to be the most cost-effective way to reduce energy use and
    greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, such improvements usually lower the cost of using energy-intensive goods and may create
    wealth from the energy savings, both of which lead to increased energy use, a “rebound’’ effect. Disagreements about
    the magnitude of energy efficiency rebound are immense and play a central role in debates over the role energy efficiency
    can play in combating climate change. But these differing views seem to stem as much from the lack of a common framework
    for the analysis as from different estimates of key parameters. I present a theoretical framework that parses rebound
    into economic income and substitution effects.

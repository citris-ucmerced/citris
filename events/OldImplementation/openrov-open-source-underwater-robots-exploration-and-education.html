  <p>
    OpenROV is a open-source underwater robot. But it's so much more. It's also a community of people who are working together
    to create more accessible, affordable, and awesome tools for underwater exploration. The backbone of the project is the
    global community of DIY ocean explorers who are working, tinkering and improving the OpenROV design. The community ranges
    from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's
    feedback and input is valued. The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to explore an
    underwater cave. After finding a global community of co-developers on Kickstarter, the project has evolved into a network
    of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world.</p>

    This talk reports on a study about the impact of crowdsourcing on a law-making process in Finland. In the studied process,
    the off-road traffic law reform was opened for public participation in Finland by the Ministry of the Environment. The
    citizens were first asked to share their experiences and problems with off-road traffic and the regulating law on an
    online platform. Then the participants were asked to share solutions for those problems. Crowdsourcing resulted into
    500 ideas, over 4,000 comments and 24,000 votes, which were analyzed and evaluated both by the crowd by using a new tool
    called CrowdConsensus and by a globally distributed expert panel. The talk discusses deliberative aspects in crowdsourcing
    and the usefulness of blended expertise, i.e. the mixture of the crowd's and experts' knowledge, in law-making. Furthermore,
    the talk discusses the concepts of representation and legitimacy in a crowdsourced policy-making process. The Finnish
    experiment is one of the first empirical studies about crowdsourcing in legislative processes. Such democratic innovations
    hold the potential to improve citizen empowerment and participation in the age of democratic recession and deteriorating
    political institutions. More about the Finnish experiment here: http://thegovlab.org/seven-lessons-from-the-crowdsourced-law-reform-in-f...
    *Tanja Aitamurto* is a visiting researcher at the Data and Democracy Initiative at UC Berkeley. The Data and Democracy
    Initiative is at the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS). Previously she studied
    at the Program on Liberation Technology at the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law at Stanford. She
    examines how collective intelligence, whether harvested by crowdsourcing, co-creation or open innovation, impacts processes
    in journalism, public policy making and design process. Her work has been published in several academic publications,
    such as the New Media and Society. Related to her studies, she advises the Government and the Parliament of Finland about
    Open Government principles, for example about how open data and crowdsourcing can serve democracy.

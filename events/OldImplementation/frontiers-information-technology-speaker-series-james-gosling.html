        James Gosling is set to come to UC Merced to speak on his professional journey through various tech fields, and share how
        he landed on his current project: developing autonomous scientific aquatic drones in the Pacific ocean. James Gosling
        received a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, Canada in 1977. He received a PhD in Computer
        Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1983. The title of his thesis was "The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints".
        He spent many years as a VP and Fellow at Sun Microsystems. He has built satellite data acquisition systems, a multiprocessor
        version of Unix, several compilers, mail systems and window managers. He has also built a WYSIWYG text editor, a
        constraint based drawing editor and a text editor called `Emacs' for Unix systems. At Sun his early activity was
        as lead engineer of the NeWS window system. He did the original design of the Java programming language and implemented
        its original compiler and virtual machine. He has been a contributor to the Real-Time Specification for Java, and
        a researcher at Sun labs where his primary interest was software development tools. He then was the Chief Technology
        Officer of Sun's Developer Products Group and the CTO of Sun's Client Software Group. He briefly worked for Oracle
        after the acquisition of Sun. After a year off, he spent some time at Google and is now the chief software architect
        at Liquid Robotics where he spends his time writing software for the Waveglider, an autonomous ocean-going robot.

    Cyber Aware Day is a unique event hosted in partnership between UC Merced and San Jose State University to raise awareness
    around the cyber security sector and related opportunities for students of all backgrounds. Join an awesome line-up of
    speakers and industry experts who know first-hand that everybody belongs in security and hear their stories of how they
    found their way to cyber security. You’ll have an opportunity to also interact directly with like-minded companies who
    know the value of diversity.

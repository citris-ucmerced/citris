    Cyber Aware Day was a unique event hosted in partnership between UC Merced and San Jose State University to raise awareness
    around the cyber security sector and related opportunities for students of all backgrounds. Thank you for joining an awesome line-up of
    speakers and industry experts who know first-hand that everybody belongs in security and hear their stories of how they
    found their way to cyber security.

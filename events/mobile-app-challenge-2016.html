    Mobile App Challenge teams that move on from the semifinals will have their final presentations on May 13th at 1:15pm in
    COB 102, with the final award ceremony taking place at 2:45pm. The Mobile App Challenge finals will be part of the Innovate
    to Grow event on May 13th, where students from Capstone design groups and Engineering Service Learning teams will also
    be presenting their work. We encourage those interested to show up early for the poster presentation session at 11:00am
    in the gym, where teams will have a chance to answer questions and describe their work in detail.

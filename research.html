                                        CITRIS and the Banatao Institute bring together hundreds of affiliated faculty
                                        members and students to generate social and economic impact. Together with more
                                        than 70 public and private collaborators, we are shaping the future of
                                        technology in ways that cross traditional boundaries. Sustainable solutions for
                                        society's complex infrastructure, governance, and economic needs will be found
                                        at the intersection of diverse disciplines - each working together in the spirit
                                        of the University of California's ingenuity and public mission. Building on a
                                        15-year record of success, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute are uniquely
                                        positioned to discover and accelerate these interdisciplinary innovations for
                                        the benefit of California and the world.

                                        Our faculty and students gain the opportunity to see firsthand where
                                        technological needs and markets are headed and can bring their expertise to bear
                                        on these challenges. In turn, industrial and institutional partners gain access
                                        to leading-edge research at one of the top public university systems in the
                                        world, along with the ability to recruit outstanding students and place visiting
                                        fellows or entrepeneurs in CITRIS-affiliated research labs.

                                        Our research initiatives apply deep expertise to emerging frontiers of
                                        information technology: Sustainable Infrastructures, People and Robots,
                                        Connected Communities, and Health. Several themes cut across all four
                                        initiatives, including opportunities in data analytics, attention to resilience
                                        strategies, and a global lens on IT applications. Our focus on solving complex,
                                        large-scale challenges exemplifies the interdisciplinary mission and strengths
                                        of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute.

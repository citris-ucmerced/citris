                    The human desire to release from the earth and soar through the skies is universal. 
                    Drones offer that lightness while serving as a gateway technology.

                    FLY CITRIS inspires students to take flight, bringing UC Merced engineering undergraduates to campuses and community events in the Central Valley. 
                    The near-peer mentors show participants that they can be pilots and continue in higher education. Children of all ages (even preschoolers) can manually fly the drones through an obstacle course or program the drones to do tricks in a sequence with Python code and a bluetooth connection. 
                    Teamwork, spatial and three-dimensional thinking, mission planning, production of images and video, and solving engineering puzzles are all part of the activities for kids to pursue with the Tello drone kits and DJI minis. 
                    CITRIS UC Merced drove the UC Merced Mobi or Mobile Maker Lab in Spring 2022 and were able to buy equipment thanks to Siemens donating to our program.

                    By offering take home activities, including safe drone flight training, participants can continue aviation and eventually may make their way to UC Merced's labs that use drones for research. Since its start in 2022, CITRIS undergraduate engineering students have served 600 young aviators with drone education programming, and through the CalTeach Bobcat Summer STEM academy on campus, 21 students were able to get a week's worth of high-flying fun.

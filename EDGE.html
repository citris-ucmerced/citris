                                    Despite significant efforts to increase the enrollment and graduation rate of women
                                    and other under-included identities in STEM disciplines, the high attrition rate of
                                    female and BIPOC engineers in industry is a looming threat to the future of the U.S.
                                    economy. Negative workplace experiences have been found to be the most significant
                                    reason for leaving engineering careers.

                                    Our goal is to strive for a world in which women and all identities in technical
                                    fields are proportionately represented and equitably compensated throughout the
                                    professional ranks in industry, academia, and the public sector.

                                    In 2017, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute and the UC Berkeley College of Engineering
                                    came together to launch the Women in Tech Initiative at the University of California
                                    building on the prior efforts of Tsu-Jae King Liu and Camille Crittenden, both of UC
                                    Berkeley. In March 2021, the program changed its name to the <b>Expanding Diversity
                                        and Gender Equity in Tech Initiative</b> (EDGE in Tech) to better reflect
                                    efforts to
                                    address
                                    intersectionality and more nuanced barriers to equitable participation in tech.

                                    The EDGE in Tech Initiative at the University of California (EDGE in Tech) is
                                    committed to addressing the challenges faced by women and other under-included
                                    identities in engineering and computer science fields by serving as a trusted center
                                    and resource that integrates research with action.

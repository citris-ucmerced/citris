                                        <p>The CITRIS Workforce Innovation Program helps UC students pursue world-changing research and accelerate their careers.</p>

                                        <p>Applications are due Monday, Jan. 30.</p>
                                            
                                        <p>The program offers select University of California students the opportunity to inform their career decisions through eight-week paid internships, where they’ll build in-demand skills through on-the-job experience. Participants will receive training in leadership and project management, and will be supported throughout the internship program by dedicated CITRIS staff, as well as the community of peers in their cohort.    
                                            CITRIS and the Banatao Institute invite undergraduates from all majors at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Merced and UC Santa Cruz to apply for placements in one of five areas of emerging IT innovation important to the state of California: aviation, climate and energy, digital health, robotics, and semiconductors. 
                                            Students who represent the rich diversity of the University of California, including women, people from underrepresented backgrounds, Pell Grant recipients, undocumented students and first-generation students, are encouraged to apply.

                                        UC Merced engineering students have created a program to inspire middle school
                                        students about STEM. The program brings an innovative and fun tech curriculum in
                                        order to introduce programming, engineering problem-solving and team science,
                                        along with helping them develop a sense of identity in STEM. UC Merced students
                                        take on the role of NexTech educators and guide the middle school students
                                        through building several versions of robots and puzzles. Students can see
                                        themselves succeeding in technology after exploring NexTech Robotics.

                                        CITRIS @ UC Merced’s innovative computer science and robotics program has been
                                        serving San Joaquin Valley middle
                                        school students since 2015. Developed by a UC Merced undergraduate student,
                                        NexTech Robotics engages every kind
                                        of computer scientist, from logic-based programming to wireless control.
                                        Students work independently and in teams
                                        to develop computational thinking. Through in-class and after-school sessions
                                        NexTech students practice scratch
                                        and block coding, learn about sensors, run competitive courses, and solve
                                        problems.

                                        an element of fun and illustrate a pathway to success in higher education. The
                                        interns over time have added units on drones, CAD and unmanned aerial systems
                                        (UASs); Python and HTML code to make websites; and general engineering concepts.

                                        California needs teachers, especially in STEM fields. UC Merced’s CalTeach
                                        program trains teachers in natural
                                        sciences and math, and the UCsystem contributes over 5% of credentialed teachers
                                        to the profession each year.
                                        But many undergraduate students don’t realize their potential in education.
                                        NexTech affords multiple students
                                        an opportunity to try teaching with real students. Many of them continue. By
                                        working in pairs, they learn
                                        pedagogical tools, classroom management, and how to create engaging curriculum.

                                        the COVID-19 shelter-in-place took effect, NexTech went online
                                        using web-based emulators instead of the physical
                                        robots. We plan to expand to serve online and weekends as well as go beyond
                                        Merced-city schools by adding new
                                        locations when possible.

                                    <p>
                                        Robots are fun, creative and present multi-dimensional problems that translate
                                        into engineering, math and computer science skills. They’re also a gateway to
                                        engage many student interestsand skills.

                                    <p>A leading issue in the San Joaquin valley is the ability for low-income students
                                        to explore STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) beyond the
                                        typical classroom setting. This program was designed to change how students see
                                        themselves in STEM and how they think about problems, logic, and computers.The
                                        region’s population is also considered historically underrepresented in STEM
                                        education and technology careers. By interveningin middle school--when young
                                        women tend toopt-out of STEM and when students are developing their occupational
                                        identity—NexTechenables mentoring from near-peers, develops teamwork, and
                                        creates lasting connections among students who might otherwise not have classes
                                        together.

                                    <p>
                                        With the growing need to enhance STEM beyond the classroom, UC Merced
                                        engineering students have created a
                                        program to solve this need for middle school students. The program brings
                                        innovative and fun tech curriculum
                                        o middle school students to programing, develops a sense of identity in STEM,
                                        and encourages cooperative group
                                        problem-solving. UC Merced students take on the role of NexTech educators and
                                        guide the middle school students
                                        through building several versions of robotsand puzzles. Students can see
                                        themselves succeeding in technology after
                                        exploring NexTech Robotics.

                                    <p>
                                        CITRIS @ UC Merced’s innovative computer science and robotics program has been
                                        serving San Joaquin Valley middle
                                        school students since 2016. Developed by a UC Merced undergraduate student,
                                        NexTech Robotics engages every kind
                                        of computer scientist, from logic-based programming to wireless control.
                                        Students work independently and in teams
                                        to develop computational thinking. Through in-class and after-school sessions
                                        NexTech students practice scratch
                                        and block coding, learn about sensors, run competitive courses, and solve
                                        problems.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        CITRIS NexTech Education interns—undergraduate students majoring in Computer
                                        Science and Engineering—serve as
                                        near-peers who bring an element of fun. The interns over time have added units
                                        on drones and unmanned aerial
                                        systems (UASs); HTML code to make websites; general engineering concepts; and
                                        more.
                                    </p>

                                        California needs teachers, especially in STEM fields. UC Merced’s CalTeach
                                        program trains teachersin natural
                                        sciences and math, and the UCsystemcontributes over 5% of credentialed teachers
                                        to the professioneach year.
                                        But many undergraduate students don’t realize their potential in education.
                                        NexTech affords multiple students
                                        an opportunity to try teachingwith real students. Many of them continue. By
                                        working in pairs, they learn
                                        pedagogical tools, classroommanagement, and how to create engaging curriculum.

                                        can inspire students to see themselves in computer science, STEM and higher

                                        CITRIS offers NexTech in several formats with plans to expand outreach. NexTech
                                        in thepast served Tenaya,
                                        Cruickshank and HooverMiddle Schools through in-class and after-school programs
                                        lasting 6-10 weeks. When
                                        the COVID-19 shelter-in-place took effect, NexTech went online

                                        robots. We plan to expand to serve online and weekends as well as gobeyond

                                    <p>
                                        Robots are fun, creative and present multi-dimensional problems that translate
                                        into engineering, math and computer science skills. They’re also a gateway to
                                        engage many student interestsand skills.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>A leading issue in the San Joaquin valley is the ability for low-income students
                                        to explore STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) beyond the
                                        typical classroom setting. This program was designed to change how students see
                                        themselves in STEM and how they think about problems, logic, and computers.The
                                        region’s population is also considered historically underrepresented in STEM
                                        education and technology careers. By interveningin middle school--when young
                                        women tend toopt-out of STEM and when students are developing their occupational
                                        identity—NexTechenables mentoring from near-peers, develops teamwork, and
                                        creates lasting connections among students who might otherwise not have classes
                                        together.

                                    <u><b>Overview:</b></u>

                                    <p>The objective of Fresno-Merced Future of Food Innovation Initiative (or F3) is to
                                        leverage the Fresno-Merced region’s industry concentration and expertise to
                                        develop a world-class, Climate-Smart Food and Ag Tech Engineering Cluster that
                                        develops advanced, sustainable food production and food manufacturing focused on
                                        cross-disciplinary engineering capabilities. To help achieve this aim, the F3
                                        Collaborative R&D Challenge will provide matching funds and seed funds to
                                        affiliated research teams. As an F3 activity, the F3 Collaborative R&D Challenge
                                        will serve as a catalyst for the ag-food-tech cluster aspirations of F3 and, by
                                        underwriting this activity, it will spur much needed evidence for collaboration
                                        between CSU Fresno, UC Merced, and UC ANR – a requisite for further
                                        consideration of joint Ph.D. degree development. </p>

                                    <p>The F3 Challenge Grant Program will support collaborative research and
                                        development initiatives, enhance cooperation among institutions, and facilitate
                                        innovation in ag-food-tech. In the interest of expanding and enhancing
                                        collaborative R&D among academics, industry partners, and community stakeholders
                                        in sustainable solutions to pressing food system challenges, F3 encourages
                                        proposals for early-stage research projects that support <b>climate-smart food

                    The vision of the UC Sprouts program is to provide quality supplemental STEM education to elementary students in the Merced
                    community by developing and executing a curriculum that will allow them to plant and tend to an edible
                    garden. During the early developmental phases, CITRIS has supported this initiative by providing the
                    initial funding needed to purchase the necessary resources. Elementary students will get the chance to
                    learn about plant development, nutritious eating, the importance of recycling and composting, and learn
                    about going to college from other UC Merced students.

        California’s Central Valley is one of the most important agricultural hubs in the world; meanwhile, the region experiences
        a continuous brain-drained as talented youth, college graduates and professionals pursue career opportunities outside
        of the valley. This disconnect between higher education and our local communities has decreased the rate of environmental
        literacy in Merced County. According to the Nation’s Report Card, 66% of 4th graders are scoring basic or below proficient
        in reading and a respective 59% in mathematics throughout the U.S. From these statistics, we can extrapolate that
        environmental literacy education has been overlooked. This is a serious problem that jeopardizes the future of our
        natural resources nationally.

        Meanwhile, UC Merced has established itself as a leader in environmental sustainability and energy efficiency in an area
        that is heavily dependent on the preservation of our natural ecosystem for economic success. With a multitude of
        programs available to those interested in Earth Sciences, there are many opportunities for students- and by extension,
        the community – to discover the beauty of preserving and maintain the resources which are an essential component
        to California’s vitality.

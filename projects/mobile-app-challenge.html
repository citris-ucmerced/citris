                    The Mobile App Challenge (MAC) is a semester long competition in which interdisciplinary teams of students from the University
                    of California, Merced develop mobile apps that have a positive impact on communities. For teams that
                    wish to continue developing or marketing their apps, CITRIS collaborates with the UC Merced Venture Lab
                    to help the team grow their business. Every two weeks, a workshop is held to assist participants in the
                    design process, so that students have the resources and feedback to continually refine their aps into
                    apps that are beneficial and useful.

        CITRIS reaches out to industry leaders to sponsor and fund the prizes awarded for the Mobile App Challenge. Students are
        given the opportunity to network with sponsors at CITRIS hosted events, and are offered assistance with their mobile
        apps throughout the semester by CITRIS staff. Results: In 2016, the Mobile App Challenge attained the highest rate
        of participation by 206%. More than 95 participants with over 20 mobile app ideas presented at the Mobile App Challenge
        Semi-Finals. Many students that participate in the Mobile App Challenge are offered internships from our sponsors.
        One team got offered summer internships at PGE for creating an app called UpNote, an app that helps students to
        study for their classes. In 2015, the winner of the Mobile App Challenge was Switch, a universal home-operating system
        can control a user’s home appliances. Switch continues to promote energy conservation with their new business, Sweep
        Energy, that develops energy-monitoring equipment to predict equipment failure before it occurs and won the 2016
        San Joaquin Entrepreneurial Challenge.

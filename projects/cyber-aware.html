                    The purpose and goal of hosting a VLAB event and Cyber Awareness Day is to ultimately inform the community on security related
                    issues within a technology-impacted environment. Cyber Awareness Day provides opportunities for the community
                    to increase their knowledge on information security within data intensive organizations as well as connecting
                    educational leaders with industry professionals. Similar to Cyber Awareness Day, the “Internet of Insecure
                    Things” VLAB event focuses on a panel discussion that addresses Wi-Fi enabled devices and how startups
                    are competing against large corporations in the cyber security realm.

        Furthermore, the budget and agenda for Cyber Awareness Day has been completed by Steven and approved by CITRIS leadership.
        We are currently in the process of working with external sponsors to solidify additional details as well as finalizing
        the official event date. In addition, all of the logistics for the “Internet of Insecure Things” VLAB event has been
        finalized. Several CITRIS interns will be attending this event on February 21st to educate themselves on an important
        topic as well as expanding their network. At the 2016 Mobile App Challenge Semi-Finals, Steven got the chance to
        meet David Needham, the Vice President of Technology at Oportun. After demonstrating his academic excellence in business
        and passion for technology, Steven was offered an internship at Oportun within their cyber security department. He
        spent the entire summer at Oportun’s headquarters, located in the Silicon Valley, working on financial and data analysis.
        By the end of the summer, he was given the opportunity to continue his internship by joining the Information Technology
        team as a remote intern. Entering his final year at the University of California Merced, Steven continues to exceed
        standards given by CITRIS Leadership. Upon graduation, he has already secured a full-time job offer at Lockheed Martin
        Space Systems, located in the Silicon Valley, as their Multi-Functional Finance Analyst. We expect great things from
        Steven after his undergraduate career and we hope that he continues to strive for excellence in his future endeavors.

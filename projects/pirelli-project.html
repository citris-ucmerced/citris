                    Through CITRIS, the multinational tire manufacturer, Pirelli, supported students to generate a discovery report on emerging
                    trends in the automotive vehicle industry that could potentially disrupt the tire environment. This project
                    is looking to create insights on what the future landscape of vehicles will look like, and ascertain
                    the impacts on tire manufacturers from both a technical and commercial standpoint. The project is led
                    by the Associate Director of CITRIS @ UC Merced, Stefano Foresti, the commercial analysis is being developed
                    by Sophie Vo ( Management and Business Economics, B.S. c/o 2018), while the technical analysis has been
                    developed by Johnathan Deas (Mechanical Engineering, B.S. c/o 2017), Marek Abarca (Mechanical Engineering,
                    B.S. c/o 2016), Michiro Robinson (Mechanical Engineering, B.S. c/o 2018), and Deo Halili.

        These students are deep diving into the innovations that are driving technologies such as data sensing, deep learning, IOT,
        new materials, as well as autonomous, connected, electric cars and trucks, to get a better understanding of what
        the relative impacts of these technologies will be on tire manufacturers. The team has output a report outlining
        the deep dive topics at a high level, a report on the future state of the trucking industry, and documents with details
        on topics of particular interest. The team has built its research by compiling information from journal reports,
        news articles, patent searches, press releases, and interviews conducted with stakeholders in the industry. Having
        developed a strong interest in the topic from working on this project, some team members even became involved in
        the organization of the VLAB event on flying cars “The Future of Transportation: Freeway or Flyways?”, which took
        place in Palo Alto in November 2016. For the CITRIS students, it has been a highly engaging learning experience thanks
        to the enthusiasm of experts regarding what the future of the automotive industry will look like. Pirelli has been
        highly receptive of the analysis that the CITRIS team have conducted thus far, and the team looks forward to elaborating
        on the potential opportunities that it has identified for Pirelli and building out its recommendations."

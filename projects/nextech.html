The 2018 year kickstarted the first ever CITRIS NexTech Introduction to Robotics program for middle schoolers. Developed by CITRIS students, the introductory course hit upon 3 major topics: programming, design, and embedded systems. NexTech made its debut at a local Merced middle school, not too far from the UC Merced campus. 
Seventh and eighth grade students participated in an 8-week long before-school program, where they challenged their critical thinking to accomplish different tasks focused around robot teleoperated and autonomous movement, sensor integration, and coding optimization to create environment-aware robots. Many participating students had never experienced working with robotic systems or coding before, making NexTech a new and exciting program for the young students.
Throughout the course, students learned about and incorporated various sensors into their robot, such as gyroscopes, bumper switches, color detectors, and encoders. Mechanically, students touched upon topics of physics, good design practices, and gear ratios. Initially, the program was set to be a 6-week program, but at the request of the students, the program was extended another 2 weeks. The extended two weeks enabled them to switch from graphical robotC programming to an introduction to traditional language robotC coding. 
Overall, the middle schoolers demonstrated their dedication to the program, and walked away with a greater appreciation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). To the NexTech teaching team, the program was a huge success. The program enabled students an educational outlet outside of a standard classroom and focused on how fun engineering can be. The instructional team hopes that the program will continue to develop different levels of the program, expand to summer courses, and continue to inspire the youth of Merced to experience the world of STEM.

Special thanks to Cruikshank Middle School for pioneering this program!

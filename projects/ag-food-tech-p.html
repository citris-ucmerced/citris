                    The University of California, Merced is in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most
                    agriculturally productive regions in the world and a testbed for innovation. We partner with
                    industry leaders, growers, and natural resources managers as well as the UCANR Agricultural Research
                    and Extension Center to develop the next generation of agricultural leaders, to establish
                    employment-education experiences and preparation, and to invent the next technological solution to
                    agricultural, food and natural resource issues in the San Joaquin Valley and beyond.

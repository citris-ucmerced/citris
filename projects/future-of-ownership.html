                    The current construct of our society consists heavily of a rising trend known as the “sharing economy”. This type of sharing
                    ranges from personal information, to vehicles, to property, and we contribute to it daily by simply existing.
                    When data is acquired without our knowledge, our identity becomes less personal, and more accessible.
                    This poses a threat to the public because of the negative consequences associated with it.

        In order to understand the future concerns of this trend, CITRIS has created a project that will hopefully bring forth knowledge
        regarding this potential harm. The main purpose of this project is to examine the current state of ownership, which
        would allow us to make predictions about the future, and possibly create the incentive to change. As more research
        is conducted, there seems to be a connection between loss of ownership to decrease of wealth, an important correlation
        that should not be ignored. For these reasons, CITRIS believes it is unavoidable issue that we must delve further
        into. The project hopes to create a strong argument for a need of technological ownership management. CITRIS has
        provided many resources to help this project grow. Some of these resources include, but not limited to, direct support
        for the intern, connections to faculty members with expert insight to the topic, and networking opportunities that
        allow for expansion of knowledge for the project.

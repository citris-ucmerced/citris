                                        CITRIS Aviation specializes in gathering scientific data using unmanned aerial vehicles and 
                                        satellites, especially in the fields of landscape ecology and agriculture. We emphasize through 
                                        research, consultation and courses developing practical solutions, promoting the use of timely 
                                        aerial data, and understanding information.

                                            KelpFire studies how coastal wildfires deliver sediments and carbon into ocean 
                                            ecosystems, including National Marine Sanctuaries and the unique kelp-based 
                                            ecosystems. Over four years a team of geospatial experts at NASA Jet Propulsion 
                                            Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, UCLA and led by Dr. Erin Hestir and 
                                            colleagues at UC Merced will train the next generation of diverse NASA innovators and 
                                            advance understanding and forecasting of wildfire on the California coast. The 
                                            multidisciplinary research focuses on several wildfire impacted watersheds along the 
                                            California coast.

                                            Through cross-disciplinary research, NASA is conducting its first biodiversity field 
                                            campaign by assembling airborne imageing spectroscopy, LIDAR, and field observations of 
                                            a critical and highly diverse area of the world, the South African Greater Cape Floristic 
                                            Regionâ€™s coastal and marine environments. Dr. Erin Hestir co-directs the program that is 
                                            designed to engage scholars from South Africa and to improve understanding of the 
                                            distribution and abundance of biodiversity, the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function, 
                                            and the impacts of biodiversity change on ecosystem services.

                                            The quality of freshwater resources is a concern shared by humanity across the world, vital 
                                            to preserving agriculture, ecosystems, and our communities. UC Merced and UC Davis 
                                            have teamed up with CSIRO Australia to join an international constellation of space and 
                                            ground sensor systems integrated into a near-real time space-based IoT system to deliver 
                                            timely water information to those that need it most. Using California as a key pilot site for 
                                            development, UC Merced is leading research that will inform sensor development and data 
                                            integration from ground-based sensors, space-based sensors, advanced analytics, and 
                                            predictive modeling to delivery decision-ready information to end-users.

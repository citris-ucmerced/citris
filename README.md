# CITRIS @ UC Merced

The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute create information technology solutions for society's most pressing challenges. 

# For Developers/Maintainers

This site is built using HTML, with jQuery as a light-weight CMS, powered by a local DB in the form of CSV files for relevant content sets.

It is important to keep image sizings, text blurbs, and any format-sensitive additions to the website consistent. 

### Style Guide

CITRIS and the Banatao Institute has a comprehensive Style and Branding Guide which this website aims to follow. This includes things such as: using accurate names of CITRIS' initiatives and programs, using images that are both bright and high in contrast, and more. You should review the guide before making changes to the website.

### Image Sizes

All images on the website are consistently sized to ensure rendering of the website is consistent across platforms. This includes:

- Headshot images: 480x480px
- Banners: 1170x398px
- Events: 800x400px

When in doubt, base any sizes off of pre-existing images to ensure consistency.

# CITRIS @ UC Merced

The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute create information technology solutions for society's most pressing challenges. 

## For Developers/Maintainers

This site is built using HTML, with jQuery as a light-weight CMS, powered by a local DB in the form of CSV files for relevant content sets.

It is important to keep image sizings, text blurbs, and any format-sensitive additions to the website consistent.

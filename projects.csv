ag-food-tech,,Ag-Food-Tech,,,"The University of California, Merced is in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world and a testbed for innovation. We partner with industry leaders, growers, and natural resources managers as well as the UCANR Agricultural Research and Extension Center to develop the next generation of agricultural leaders, to establish employment-education experiences and preparation, and to invent the next technological solution to agricultural, food and natural resource issues in the San Joaquin Valley and beyond."
uc-sprouts,adriana-gomez,,Adriana Gomez,UC Sprouts Program Intern,"The vision of the UC Sprouts program is to provide quality supplemental STEM education to elementary students in the Merced community by developing and executing a curriculum that will allow them to plant and tend to an edible garden. During the early developmental phases, CITRIS has supported this initiative by providing the initial funding needed to purchase the necessary resources. Elementary students will get the chance to learn about plant development, nutritious eating, the importance of recycling and composting, and learn about going to college from other UC Merced students."
cyber-aware,steven-dinh,Internet of Insecure Things: VLAB Event and Cyber Awareness Day,Steven Dinh,Information Security Awareness Intern,"The purpose and goal of hosting a VLAB event and Cyber Awareness Day is to ultimately inform the community on security related issues within a technology-impacted environment. Cyber Awareness Day provides opportunities for the community to increase their knowledge on information security within data intensive organizations as well as connecting educational leaders with industry professionals. Similar to Cyber Awareness Day, the 'Internet of Insecure Things' VLAB event focuses on a panel discussion that addresses Wi-Fi enabled devices and how startups are competing against large corporations in the cyber security realm."
ccev,johnathan-deas,CCEV: Constant Current Electric Vehicle,Johnathan Deas,Electric Vehicle Intern,"Johnathan Deas is the electric vehicle intern for CITRIS at the University of California, Merced. His duties include developing a dynamic stator control system for use in what could become a potentially more efficient electric motor. The intention is to allow more constant usage of current in order to extend the life of current battery technologies. While this project is currently in its early stages, much of the groundwork has been made in creating a state-space model. The intended goal of this project is to create a detailed mathematical model of this motor and control system."
mobile-app-challenge,myka-alejandre,Mobile App Challenge,Myka Alejandre,Mobile App Challenge Coordinator,"The Mobile App Challenge (MAC) is a semester long competition in which interdisciplinary teams of students from the University of California, Merced develop mobile apps that have a positive impact on communities. For teams that wish to continue developing or marketing their apps, CITRIS collaborates with the UC Merced Venture Lab to help the team grow their business. Every two weeks, a workshop is held to assist participants in the design process, so that students have the resources and feedback to continually refine their aps into apps that are beneficial and useful."
pirelli-project,sophie-vo,Pirelli Project,Sophie Vo,Technology and Innovation Intern,"Through CITRIS, the multinational tire manufacturer, Pirelli, supported students to generate a discovery report on emerging trends in the automotive vehicle industry that could potentially disrupt the tire environment. This project is looking to create insights on what the future landscape of vehicles will look like, and ascertain the impacts on tire manufacturers from both a technical and commercial standpoint. The project is led by the Associate Director of CITRIS @ UC Merced, Stefano Foresti, the commercial analysis is being developed by Sophie Vo ( Management and Business Economics, B.S. c/o 2018), while the technical analysis has been developed by Johnathan Deas (Mechanical Engineering, B.S. c/o 2017), Marek Abarca (Mechanical Engineering, B.S. c/o 2016), Michiro Robinson (Mechanical Engineering, B.S. c/o 2018), and Deo Halili."
catflux,shubham-naik,Catflux,Shubham Naik,Lead Application Developer,"Catflux is an event discovery application. The initiative was started from a partnership of CITRIS and the Office of the Chancellor. Built by a team of UC Merced students, this app aims to solve the 'Happenings' problem while giving students a well-designed platform to find out about new events."
future-of-ownership,winnie-chen,Future of Ownership,Winnie Chen,Data Ownership Intern,"The current construct of our society consists heavily of a rising trend known as the “sharing economy”. This type of sharing ranges from personal information, to vehicles, to property, and we contribute to it daily by simply existing. When data is acquired without our knowledge, our identity becomes less personal, and more accessible. This poses a threat to the public because of the negative consequences associated with it."
nextech,alexus-garcia,NexTech,Alexus Garcia,Robotics Intern,"The 2018 year kickstarted the first ever CITRIS NexTech Introduction to Robotics program for middle schoolers. Developed by CITRIS students, the introductory course hit upon 3 major topics: programming, design, and embedded systems. NexTech made its debut at a local Merced middle school, not too far from the UC Merced campus. Seventh and eighth grade students participated in an 8-week long before-school program, where they challenged their critical thinking to accomplish different tasks focused around robot teleoperated and autonomous movement, sensor integration, and coding optimization to create environment-aware robots. Many participating students had never experienced working with robotic systems or coding before, making NexTech a new and exciting program for the young students. Throughout the course, students learned about and incorporated various sensors into their robot, such as gyroscopes, bumper switches, color detectors, and encoders. Mechanically, students touched upon topics of physics, good design practices, and gear ratios. Initially, the program was set to be a 6-week program, but at the request of the students, the program was extended another 2 weeks. The extended two weeks enabled them to switch from graphical robotC programming to an introduction to traditional language robotC coding.  Overall, the middle schoolers demonstrated their dedication to the program, and walked away with a greater appreciation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). To the NexTech teaching team, the program was a huge success. The program enabled students an educational outlet outside of a standard classroom and focused on how fun engineering can be. The instructional team hopes that the program will continue to develop different levels of the program, expand to summer courses, and continue to inspire the youth of Merced to experience the world of STEM."

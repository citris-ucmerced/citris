                    Catflux is an event discovery application. The initiative was started from a partnership of CITRIS
                    and the Office of the
                    Chancellor. Built by a team of UC Merced students, this app aims to solve the 'Happenings' problem
                    while
                    giving students a well-designed platform to find out about new events.

        Registration is Open for Pitchfest, 2016

        Registration is now open for the Fifth Annual Entrepreneurial Seminar and Pitchfest, taking place on April 30th
        in the Kolligian Library. Come learn from entrepreneurs and investors, take workshops and participate in one or
        both of the student pitch competitions. The event is open to all students and everyone will receive a guide to
        generating a strong pitch, with sample videos.

        This year we are featuring two competitions:

        The Ruiz Prize in Entrepreneurial Communication: Individuals will deliver short, 3-minute pitches of original
        business concepts or nonprofits. No visual aids are allowed—only good ideas and a great pitch. The $300 Ruiz
        Prize in Entrepreneurial Communication is sponsored by the Ruiz Family Chair in Entrepreneurship.
        The UCM Venture Lab Team Challenge: Teams will be given a specific “Entrepreneurial Scenario” that will
        challenge participants to generate innovative ideas on a specific area of opportunity. This year’s
        Entrepreneurial Scenario is Virtual Reality. All registrants will receive a guide to the Entrepreneurial
        Scenario, with helpful research and tips on areas of opportunity. Teams will deliver 3-minute pitches with no
        visual aids on a Virtual Reality business concept. Join with a set team or have a team randomly assigned.
        Members of The Entrepreneurial Society of UCM (TESUM) will join the random team pool. The winning team receives
        $500, sponsored by the UCM Venture Lab.

        Participants are encouraged to attend a Pitch Development Workshop, open to all, hosted by John Haner on April
        22nd, from 3-5pm in COB 113. The workshop will go from 3-4pm, followed by discussion of the Team Challenge
        scenario.

        Pitchfest will begin with a networking coffee in the Lantern at 10am, where students will register and sign up
        for workshops. Students will select two workshops from a menu of offerings. The seminar will begin at 11 am with
        a panel discussion in the Green Room of the Kolligian Library. Workshops will take place in COB after the panel,
        and participants can choose to participate in a practice pitch round with feedback during the second workshop.
        For the first round of the competition, students will pitch in small library rooms to a couple judges. Finalists
        will be selected and a final round of pitches will be held in the Green Room, followed by a brief awards
        ceremony.

        The speaker lineup will be blasted on TESUM.org and the official TESUM Facebook page, and programs will be
        delivered prior to the event.

        Pitchfest is organized by the The Entrepreneurial Society of UCM (TESUM), The Merritt Writing Program, The Ruiz
        Chair in Entrepreneurship, with support from the Center for Career and Professional Advancement, ASUCM, and the
        UCM Venture Lab.

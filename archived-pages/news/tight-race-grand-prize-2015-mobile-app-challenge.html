                This year, the CITRIS orchestrated Mobile App Challenge had a particularly tight race to win the Grand
                Prize of $5000. The 7 finalists went through another round of judging as part of the School of
                Engineering's Innovate to Grow event involving pitches and poster presentations. Honorable mentions were
                given to teams Pill ID and Spinewatch. In the end, team Switch with an app that can wirelessly control
                home appliances took home the prize.

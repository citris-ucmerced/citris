    The 2014 CITRIS Mobile App Challenge concluded Friday, May 16th with Music Notes taking home the Grand Prize. This
    year, the challenge was part of the School of Engineering's annual Innovate to Grow event where students showcase
    projects they've been working on all semester.

    The event began with a poster session in the Gym where students explained and demonstrated their apps to judges and
    attendees. Afterwards, the finalist teams each gave 6 minute pitches to a room full of observers and judges.

    Deliberations were tense, but in the end, the judges picked Music Notes to take the Grand Prize of $5000.

    Music Notes is an on-the-go music editing application designed for professional and amateur musicians. Taking
    inspiration from the concept of a notepad, it allows you to compose and play music quickly on your phone wherever
    you are. Team Members: Andrew Ibarra, Chris Chew, Connor Kanazawa, Robert Wang.

    For an insider's perspective on the process of being a participant, ShowerLess team member Nick Fong described his
    experience with the Mobile App Challenge in IBMs Students for a Smarter Planet blog. You can see his posts here:

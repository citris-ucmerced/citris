         The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) launched in 2001. Our research collaborations focus on these core initiatives: Energy, Health Care, Infrastructure, and Data and Democracy (these initiatives haven since shaped themselves into the initatives we see today: Health, People and Robots, Sustainable Infrastructues, and Connected Communities).

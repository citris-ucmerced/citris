        Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and assistive technologies will transform the future of work,
        with wide-ranging effects on employment, wages, and income distribution. Despite dystopian forecasts of robots
        replacing workers, AI and intelligent tools can also be applied to make the workforce more inclusive. As
        industries evolve, how can AI be used to extend productive professional activity, expand the available labor
        pool, support lifelong learning, and enhance human labor rather than replace it, especially for the aging and
        those with disabilities?

        Hosted by CITRIS and the Banatao Institute and Microsoft, “Putting AI to Work” will bring together leading
        scholars, practitioners, industry representatives, and community organizations to discuss the pace and extent of
        the effects of AI on the future of work in relation to aging and disability. Panelists will consider a range of
        issues regarding workforce, technology and design trends for target populations, and policy questions for a new
        era of automated and adaptive workplaces.

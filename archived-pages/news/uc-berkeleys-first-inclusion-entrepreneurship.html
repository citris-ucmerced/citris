        On September 15th, 2017, UC Berkeley and 14 federal funding agencies will provide 350 entrepreneurs the opportunity to partner directly with federal SBIR/STTR program managers to help them gain access to $2,000,000 in non-dilutive funding.

        Be one of those 350 entrepreneurs to meet one-on-one with 25 SBIR/STTR program managers and get feedback on how to fund your idea through SBIR grants. Learn about how to overcome common mistakes in the SBIR application process, and ensure that you've accurately and effectively portrayed your technology.
        
        Highlights of the event include:
        
            Learning how to access local and state resources available to innovators, researchers, and technology entrepreneurs

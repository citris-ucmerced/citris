    The UC Merced Vernal Pools Reserve in partnership with the Merced County UC Cooperative Extension Office and Upper
    Merced River Watershed Council will offer another UC California Naturalist certificate training in Spring 2016 on
    the campus of UC Merced.

    Students in the California Naturalist Program will become part of a committed corps of volunteer naturalists and
    citizen scientists, equipped with the skills needed to take an active role in local natural resource conservation,
    restoration and environmental education. This 10-week training combines science instruction with guest speakers,
    field trips, and project-based learning to explore the unique ecology and natural history of the San Joaquin Valley
    and central Sierra Nevada foothills region. This course will cover basic ecology, watershed concepts, geology,
    wildlife, plant communities, and global environmental issues, as well as tools for collaborative conservation and
    communication. There will also be opportunities for bird watching, wildflower identification, sketching, and
    journaling!

    Thursday evening classes will be held at UC Merced, and four Saturday field trips will be held in representative
    areas of the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. Course instructors are UC Merced faculty and other
    regional experts. Upon completion of the course, students will receive the UC California Naturalist’s certificate.

    February 11 to April 21, 2016. Scholarships available.

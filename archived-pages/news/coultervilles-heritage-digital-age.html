        "Coulterville’s Heritage in the Digital Age" is an exhibit that features the work that has been done by the
        University of California Merced towards a larger project to digitally preserve the natural and cultural
        resources along the John Muir trail in the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada Foothills.
        The work in Coulterville has focused on:
        3D scanning and modelling of the physical
        historic buildings
        Cataloguing archives and photographs
        Video interviews with residents
        Recording the historic cemeteries
        The exhibit will open on April 2 with an event allowing members of the public to digitally interact with some of
        the 3D models, view select video interviews, and explore the virtual exhibit website. It will close on April 24
        with a second event showcasing these digital approaches to heritage preservation.

                                    CITRIS announces a mentoring opportunity this summer for historically
                                    under-represented undergraduate and graduate students in STEM. Current mentoring
                                    practices, while purporting to address diversity have been shown to primarily
                                    benefit students of privilege. The CITRIS EDGE in STEM Mentoring Program is designed
                                    to broaden career mentoring to benefit women and historically under-represented
                                    students in STEM by focusing on shared values and reducing the power dynamics in
                                    mentoring relationships.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This program pairs undergraduate and graduate students from UC Merced, UC Davis,
                                    and UC Berkeley together for near-peer mentoring. The program will provide
                                    opportunities for mentorship training and education for both mentors and mentees.
                                    Graduate students will learn effective mentoring tools and techniques. Undergraduate
                                    students will learn how to establish a network across UC campuses and to manage
                                    mentoring relationships for their career development. The program will help
                                    undergraduate and graduate students gain equitable access to effective mentorship.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Participants will meet for 90 minutes on Mondays June 14th - August 16th over online
                                    platforms such as Zoom and the online mentoring platform <a href=https://epixego.com

                                    Upon successful completion of the program, participants will be awarded a CITRIS
                                    EDGE in STEM Mentoring Fellowship Monetary Award and Title that can be added to your

loh-flyer2,The motivation for chiplets and their Adoption in AMD Processors with Dr. Loh,NO_BUTTON,NO_BUTTON,"For decades, Moore’s Law has delivered the ability to integrate an exponentially increasing number of devices in the same silicon area at a roughly constant cost. This has enabled tremendous levels of integration, where the capabilities of computer systems that previously occupied entire rooms can now fit on a single integrated circuit. In recent times, the steady drum beat of Moore’s Law has started to slow down. Whereas device density historically doubled every 18-24 months, the rate of recent silicon process advancements has declined. While improvements in device scaling continue, albeit at a reduced pace, the industry is simultaneously observing increases in manufacturing costs. In response, the industry is now seeing a trend toward reversing direction on the traditional march toward more integration. Instead, multiple industry and academic groups are advocating that systems on chips (SoCs) be “disintegrated” into multiple smaller “chiplets.” This talk provides an overview of the technology challenges that motivated AMD to use chiplets, the technical solutions we developed for our products, and how we expanded the use of chiplets from individual processors to multiple product families. <br><br>Bio: Gabe is a Senior Fellow in AMD Research. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in computer science from Yale University in 2002 and 1999, respectively, and his B.Eng. in electrical engineering from the Cooper Union in 1998. Gabe was also a tenured associate professor in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, and a senior researcher at Intel Corporation. He is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE, recipient of ACM SIGARCH's Maurice Wilkes Award, Hall of Fame member for the MICRO, ISCA, and HPCA conferences, (co-)inventor on over ninety granted US patents, and a recipient of a U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award.","Friday, April 29, 2022 | 12-1PM",UC Merced SSB 170,,,CITRIS_FIT_LOH

Indeed, the widespread disconnect between changes in extreme precipitation and extreme streamflow contrasts with model projections and underlies what has been referred to as a “grand challenge” of hydrology. Using CHOSEN (Comprehensive Hydrologic Observatory Sensor Network), we conducted a data-driven analysis of multidimensional hydrologic and climatic extremes. We found that drought and warming likely explain many of the observed changes in streamflow extreme but that wetter extremes arise from more complex phenomena.

And if they find problems, how can they fix them? Although there are empirical processes that can be used to find “inclusivity bugs” piecemeal, what is also needed is a systematic method to assess technology’s support for diverse populations. To fill this gap, we developed GenderMag, a method for finding and fixing “gender inclusivity bugs” — gender biases in technology interfaces and workflows. We then introduced InclusiveMag, which can be used to generate systematic inclusiveness methods for other dimensions of diversity. In this talk, we explain how GenderMag works, present the latest GenderMag results, and then introduce InclusiveMag and our early experiences with it.

These applications, especially in-home long-term occupant monitoring, rely on emerging device-free human sensing techniques. From the system perspective, we introduce an alternative non-intrusive sensing modality through ambient structural vibration to indirectly infer fine-grained occupant information. However, due to the complexity of the physical world, sensing data distributions face severe domain variances. Therefore, from the data perspective, accurate information learning through pure data-driven approaches requires a large amount of labeled data, which is costly and difficult to obtain in practice.

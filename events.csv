California is an agriculturally rich state, yet its food system remains vulnerable to climate change, regulatory change, water availability, labor shortages, and unexpected disturbances. We know that automation improves efficiency. However, to create a sustainable California agri-food system, we must create a new model for agricultural technology (AgTech) design.

Even as the project fell short in many ways, it remained charismatic to many who were enchanted by its claims of a global transformation.

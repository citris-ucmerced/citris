                      The BIOSCape program is NASA's first biodiversity
                      campaign, aimed at understanding the diversity of life,
                      the factors driving it, and predicting how it may change
                      in the future. This is especially pertinent given the
                      ongoing extinction crisis and the need to protect life on
                      Earth. The University of California, Merced plays a key
                      role in this project, led by Professor Erin Hestir. The
                      campaign focuses on South Africa's Greater Cape Floristic
                      Region (GCFR), a region known for its high biodiversity,
                      including a wealth of unique marine animals. This region
                      is similar in climate to California's Central Valley and
                      faces similar pressures such as population growth,
                      wildfires, water scarcity, and climate change. In
                      collaboration with Professor Adam Wilson from the State
                      University of New York at Buffalo and local partners in
                      South Africa, the BIOSCape campaign will deploy
                      state-of-the-art NASA technology. Two NASA aircraft will
                      collect high-resolution images of the Cape and its coast,
                      capturing data beyond the visible color spectrum,
                      including ultraviolet and thermal wavelengths as well as
                      LIDAR (a method for measuring distances by illuminating
                      the target with laser light and measuring the reflection
                      with a sensor). These data will enable researchers to
                      create detailed maps of biodiversity, physiological traits
                      of organisms, and the three-dimensional structure of
                      ecosystems. Professor Hestir, apart from her leadership
                      role in the project, also serves as Associate Director of
                      the Center for Information Technology Research in the
                      Interest of Society (CITRIS) and leads the EDGE in Tech
                      Initiative: Expanding Diversity and Gender Equity at UC
                      Merced. She plans to bring her work on the BIOSCape
                      project into the classroom at UC Merced. The NASA Airborne
                      Science Program supports the BIOSCape mission, providing
                      the aircraft and sensors necessary for the data
                      collection. The research projects and flight plans for the
                      mission will be carried out by a Science Team, selected
                      from the NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth
                      Sciences (ROSES) applications.

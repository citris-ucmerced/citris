                                        BIOSCape is NASA's first biodiversity campaign, aimed at understanding the
                                        diversity of life, the factors driving it, and predicting how it may change in
                                        the future. This is especially pertinent given the ongoing extinction crisis and
                                        the need to protect life on Earth. The University of California, Merced plays a
                                        key role in this project, led by Professor Erin Hestir.

                                        The campaign focuses on South Africa's Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR), a
                                        region known for its high biodiversity, including a wealth of unique marine
                                        animals. This region is similar in climate to California's Central Valley and
                                        faces similar pressures such as population growth, wildfires, water scarcity,
                                        and climate change.
                                    </p>

                                        In collaboration with Professor Adam Wilson from the State University of New
                                        York at Buffalo and local partners in South Africa, the BIOSCape campaign will
                                        deploy state-of-the-art NASA technology. Two NASA aircraft will collect
                                        high-resolution images of the Cape and its coast, capturing data beyond the
                                        visible color spectrum, including ultraviolet and thermal wavelengths as well as
                                        LIDAR.
                                    </p>

                                        Professor Hestir, apart from her leadership role in the project, also serves as
                                        Associate Director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the
                                        Interest of Society (CITRIS) and leads the EDGE in Tech Initiative: Expanding
                                        Diversity and Gender Equity at UC Merced. She plans to bring her work on the
                                        BIOSCape project into the classroom at UC Merced.
